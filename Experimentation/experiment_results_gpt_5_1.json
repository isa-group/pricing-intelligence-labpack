            "answer": "Yes. Tableau has exactly one configuration in that price range that meets your requirements:\n\n- **Plan**: **CREATOR**\n- **Price**: **70 USD per user/month**\n- **Included capabilities**:\n  - **manageUserPermissions** \u2013 described in the pricing spec as:  \n    *\u201cManage site roles, content ownership, and user permissions.\u201d*  \n    This is what you need for managing site roles, content ownership, and user permissions.\n  - **createNewDataFlows** \u2013 described as:  \n    *\u201cCombine, shape and clean data, and save the process as a data flow.\u201d*  \n\nFrom the optimization run (filtering for prices between **40 USD** and **91 USD** and requiring both `manageUserPermissions` and `createNewDataFlows`), the only matching subscription was:\n\n```json\n{\n  \"plan\": \"CREATOR\",\n  \"addOns\": [],\n  \"cost\": \"70 $\",\n  \"features\": [\n    \"manageUserPermissions\",\n    \"curateDataSources\",\n    \"shareDataSources\",\n    \"manageContent\",\n    \"certifyDataSources\",\n    \"authorFromCuratedData\",\n    \"interactWithVisualizations\",\n    \"interactWithDashboards\",\n    \"createCustomViews\",\n    \"shareCustomViews\",\n    \"downloadVisualizationAsImages\",\n    \"downloadSummaryData\",\n    \"downloadFullData\",\n    \"commentOnDashboard\",\n    \"commentOnVisualization\",\n    \"createASubscriptionForYourself\",\n    \"receiveDataDrivenAlerts\",\n    \"createSubscriptionsForOthers\",\n    \"createDataDrivenAlerts\",\n    \"editExistingWorkbooks\",\n    \"editExistingVisualizations\",\n    \"createAndPublishNewWorkbookFromExistingDataSource\",\n    \"askData\",\n    \"createAndPublishNewWorkbookFromNewDataSources\",\n    \"createAndPublishNewDataSources\",\n    \"createNewWorkbooksBasedOnPreBuiltDashboardStarters\",\n    \"createNewDataFlows\",\n    \"editDataFlow\",\n    \"exportData\"\n  ]\n}\n```\n\nWhy this configuration:\n\n- **Price constraint**: At **70 USD**, it is within your specified **$40\u2013$91** range.\n- **Feature coverage**:\n  - It **explicitly includes** `manageUserPermissions`, which covers managing site roles, content ownership, and user permissions.\n  - It **explicitly includes** `createNewDataFlows`, giving you the ability to build and save data prep flows.\n- **Uniqueness**: No other Tableau plan or plan+add\u2011on combination in that price band in the provided pricing data simultaneously offers both of these features. For example:\n  - **EXPLORER** (35 USD) has `manageUserPermissions` but **not** `createNewDataFlows`, and is below your lower bound anyway.\n  - The **data management add-ons** add things like scheduling/running flows, but the base plans that can use them don\u2019t meet your feature combination in the 40\u201391 USD range except for CREATOR itself.\n\nSo, if you need to both manage site roles/content ownership/user permissions and create new data flows, the **Tableau CREATOR license at 70 USD per user/month** is the configuration that satisfies those requirements within your stated budget range.",

The `thirdPartyIntegrations` feature is modeled in the YAML as **on by default for all plans** (via `defaultValue: true`) and is not repeated inside each plan\u2019s `features` block, so the solver didn\u2019t \u201csee\u201d it.  \n\nWhen you account for that default behavior, configurations like **11 \u00d7 PROFESSIONAL at 15 USD/editor/month = 165 USD** clearly meet your criteria.",

Includes **both** required features, and  \n2. Falls within **$150\u2013$197/month**.\n\nYou could also mix in VIEWER/EXPLORER seats (e.g., 1 CREATOR + several VIEWERs) and stay under or within that budget, as long as you have **at least one CREATOR** to get the Dashboard Starters authoring capability.\n\n### About add\u2011ons and the tool results\n\nThe optimization search returned several **CREATOR\u2011based** subscription configurations (sometimes with Data Management or Einstein add\u2011ons). However, all such add\u2011ons are priced as **\u201cContact Sales\u201d** in the YAML, so the tools cannot produce an exact total cost; that\u2019s why their `cost` field is non\u2011numeric.\n\nFor **your specific requirements**, you **do not need any add\u2011ons**\u2014a standard **CREATOR** license already provides:\n\n- `manageUserPermissions` (site roles, content ownership, user permissions)  \n- `createNewWorkbooksBasedOnPreBuiltDashboardStarters` (Dashboard Starters)\n\nSo, concretely:\n\n- **Yes**, Tableau provides a configuration in your target price band:  \n  **two CREATOR licenses at 75.0 USD each = 150.0 USD/month**, and that includes all of the capabilities you asked about.",

            "answer": "Here\u2019s what the pricing model says once we constrain it to:\n\n- Max budget: **83\u202fUSD/month**\n- Required: **at least 2 email accounts per Workspace** (`useEmailAccountsInClickUp \u2265 2`)\n- No overage: the limit for email accounts is built into the plan/add\u2011ons, so you\u2019re not paying \u201cper extra account\u201d beyond what you configure.\n\n---\n\n## What \u201cemail accounts per Workspace\u201d means\n\nFrom the ClickUp pricing YAML:\n\n- **`useEmailAccountsInClickUp`**: \u201cThe number of email accounts per Workspace.\u201d\n- Each \u201cemail account\u201d is a real email address you connect for **Email in ClickUp** (send/receive inside ClickUp).\n- Free plan starts at **1**; paid plans and add\u2011ons increase this limit.\n- The **`extraEmailAccountInClickUp`** add\u2011on:\n  - Available for: `UNLIMITED`, `BUSINESS`, `ENTERPRISE`\n  - Price: **2\u202fUSD per account/month**\n  - Extends `useEmailAccountsInClickUp` by **+1** each time.\n\nAs long as you don\u2019t connect more accounts than your configured limit, you won\u2019t incur any overage.\n\n---\n\n## Configurations under 83\u202fUSD that give \u22652 email accounts per Workspace\n\nThe optimization tool found **6 configurations** under **83\u202fUSD/month** that meet or exceed **2 email accounts per Workspace**.  \n(All prices below are as returned by the tool, for **one member**; for multiple members, multiply by your seat count.)\n\n### 1. UNLIMITED + 1 extra email account\n\n- **Plan**: `UNLIMITED`\n- **Add-ons**: `extraEmailAccountInClickUp` (once)\n- **Email accounts allowed**: **2** (`useEmailAccountsInClickUp = 2`)\n- **Tool cost**: **`12 $` per month**\n- Why it works:\n  - Base UNLIMITED gives 1 email account.\n  - The extraEmailAccount add\u2011on adds 1 more, bringing you to 2.\n  - This is the **cheapest configuration** that meets your requirement.\n\n---\n\n### 2. UNLIMITED + extra email accounts + AI\n\n- **Plan**: `UNLIMITED`\n- **Add-ons** (per tool output): `extraEmailAccountInClickUp`, `extraEmailAccountInClickUp`  \n  (features also include `clickUpAI`)\n- **Email accounts allowed (per tool)**: **2** (`useEmailAccountsInClickUp = 2`)\n- **Tool cost**: **`19 $` per month**\n- Why it works:\n  - The configuration still exposes a limit of at least 2 email accounts per Workspace.\n  - You also get **ClickUp AI** (7\u202fUSD/member/month in the YAML) while staying far below your 83\u202fUSD budget.\n\n---\n\n### 3. BUSINESS (no add-ons)\n\n- **Plan**: `BUSINESS`\n- **Add-ons**: none\n- **Email accounts allowed**: **2** (`useEmailAccountsInClickUp = 2` in the BUSINESS plan itself)\n- **Tool cost**: **`19 $` per month**\n- Why it works:\n  - BUSINESS natively includes **2 email accounts per Workspace**, no email add\u2011on needed.\n  - Also upgrades a lot of functionality vs UNLIMITED:\n    - Unlimited automations, email/SMS automations\n    - More advanced time tracking (granular estimates, time in status, etc.)\n    - Google SSO and stronger security controls\n  - Good if you want 2 email accounts plus these **mid\u2011sized team features**.\n\n---\n\n### 4. BUSINESS + 1 extra email account\n\n- **Plan**: `BUSINESS`\n- **Add-ons**: `extraEmailAccountInClickUp` (once)\n- **Email accounts allowed**: **3** (`useEmailAccountsInClickUp = 3`)\n- **Tool cost**: **`21 $` per month**\n- Why it works:\n  - BUSINESS already includes 2 email accounts; the add-on adds capacity for 1 more.\n  - You\u2019d be **paying for 3 accounts**, but if you only use 2 you\u2019ll still be comfortably within the limit (no overages).\n\n---\n\n### 5. BUSINESS + 1 extra email account + AI\n\n- **Plan**: `BUSINESS`\n- **Add-ons** (per tool): `extraEmailAccountInClickUp`  \n  (features also include `clickUpAI`)\n- **Email accounts allowed (per tool)**: **2** (`useEmailAccountsInClickUp = 2`)\n- **Tool cost**: **`26 $` per month**\n- Why it works:\n  - You get at least 2 email accounts plus **ClickUp AI** on the BUSINESS plan.\n  - Still well below the 83\u202fUSD budget.\n\n---\n\n### 6. BUSINESS + 2 extra email accounts + AI\n\n- **Plan**: `BUSINESS`\n- **Add-ons**: `extraEmailAccountInClickUp`, `extraEmailAccountInClickUp`\n- **Email accounts allowed**: **3** (`useEmailAccountsInClickUp = 3`)\n- **Tool cost**: **`28 $` per month**\n- Why it works:\n  - You have \u22652 email accounts (3 per tool output), plus **ClickUp AI**.\n  - Again, far under 83\u202fUSD/month for a single member.\n\n---\n\n## How this fits your 83\u202fUSD/month budget\n\n- All of the above configurations cost **28\u202fUSD/month or less per member** in the tool output.\n- If your **83\u202fUSD/month** budget is for the **entire Workspace**, you can estimate:\n  - **UNLIMITED + 1 extra email account** (12\u202f$/member):\n    - Up to **6 members** \u2192 6 \u00d7 12\u202f$ = 72\u202f$ (within budget)\n  - **BUSINESS (no add-ons)** (19\u202f$/member):\n    - Up to **4 members** \u2192 4 \u00d7 19\u202f$ = 76\u202f$ (within budget)\n- For more seats than that, you\u2019d exceed 83\u202fUSD/month total and need either:\n  - A higher budget, or\n  - Fewer members / a cheaper plan configuration.\n\n---\n\n## Quick recommendation\n\nIf your only hard requirement is **2 email accounts per Workspace** and staying under **83\u202fUSD/month**:\n\n- **Most cost\u2011efficient**:  \n  **UNLIMITED + one `extraEmailAccountInClickUp` add-on** \u2192 **`12 $` per member/month**, 2 email accounts.\n- **More features for mid\u2011sized teams** (SSO, unlimited automations, richer reporting) with 2 accounts included:  \n  **BUSINESS (no add-ons)** \u2192 **`19 $` per member/month**, 2 email accounts.\n\nBoth meet your email\u2011account requirement with no overages, and both stay comfortably under your stated budget on a per\u2011member basis.",

BUSINESS plan\n\n- **Plan name:** `BUSINESS`  \n- **Price:** `79 $` per month  \n- **Included survey responses:** `surveyResponsesLimit: 50` responses/month  \n- **Surveys feature:** `surveys` is enabled  \n- **Other relevant limits:**\n  - `unlimitedSuveys: Infinity` (you can create unlimited survey forms)\n  - `unlimitedTeamMembers: Infinity`\n\nThis configuration lets you send surveys and collect **up to 50 responses per month** without exceeding the built\u2011in limit, so no overage is implied before 50 responses.\n\n### Why only BUSINESS qualifies\n\nUsing the pricing data:\n\n- **SOLO (0 $/month)**  \n  - `surveyResponsesLimit: 5` \u2192 too low (\u2264 30)\n- **STARTER (29 $/month)**  \n  - `surveyResponsesLimit: 20` \u2192 too low (\u2264 30)\n- **BUSINESS (79 $/month)**  \n  - `surveyResponsesLimit: 50` \u2192 meets the \u201cmore than 30 responses\u201d requirement and is under your 125 $ budget\n- **SCALE (159 $/month)**  \n  - `surveyResponsesLimit: 500` \u2192 enough responses, but **over your 125 $ budget**\n\nThere is one add\u2011on, `onboardingPackageAddOn` (990 $ one\u2011time), but it only adds the `onboardingPackage` feature and **does not change** any usage limits such as `surveyResponsesLimit`. Therefore, no plan + add\u2011on combination besides plain **BUSINESS** will give you >30 included responses within 125 $/month.\n\n**Answer:** Choose the **BUSINESS** plan at **79 $ per month**, with its built\u2011in `surveyResponsesLimit` of **50 responses/month**, to send surveys with more than 30 responses without overage within your $125 budget.",

            "answer": "Based on the pricing data and the solver results, **there is no Trello configuration that both**:\n\n1. Keeps your **total monthly spend at or below $185**, and  \n2. Allows you to **collaborate with more than 100 team members**  \n3. **Without hitting any workspace\u2011collaborator limit or overage.**\n\nHere\u2019s why.\n\n---\n\n## 1. Which plans can handle >100 collaborators?\n\nFrom the pricing YAML and the solver:\n\n- The only plans whose `workspaceCollaboratorsLimit` is `\"Infinity\"` are:\n  - **STANDARD** \u2013 cost: **5 $** per user/month  \n  - **STANDARD + ATLASSIAN_GUARD** \u2013 cost: **9 $** per user/month  \n  - **PREMIUM** \u2013 cost: **10 $** per user/month  \n  - **PREMIUM + ATLASSIAN_GUARD** \u2013 cost: **14 $** per user/month  \n  - **ENTERPRISE** \u2013 cost: **17.5 $** per user/month  \n\nFREE is effectively limited to about 10 collaborators (from the global default), so it cannot support >100 collaborators.\n\nFor all of the above paid plans, the `workspaceCollaboratorsLimit` is set to `.inf` (Infinity) in the YAML, meaning:\n\n- **They can support more than 100 collaborators without any collaborator-based overage fees.**\n- Cost increases linearly with the number of paid users, but there is no explicit \u201coverage\u201d surcharge for passing 100 collaborators.\n\n---\n\n## 2. Why none of them fit under $185/month for >100 collaborators\n\nTrello pricing in this model is **per user per month**. To support \u201cmore than 100 team members,\u201d we conservatively assume **>100 paid collaborators** on the same plan.\n\nLet `n` be the number of collaborators (users) and `P` the plan\u2019s per\u2011user price.\n\nWe need:\n\n- \\( n > 100 \\)  \n- \\( n \\times P \\le 185 \\) USD/month\n\nNow check each eligible configuration:\n\n1. **STANDARD** \u2013 5 $ per user/month  \n   - Max users on $185: \\( 185 / 5 = 37 \\) users  \n   - **Cannot reach >100 collaborators.**\n\n2. **STANDARD + ATLASSIAN_GUARD** \u2013 9 $ per user/month  \n   - Max users on $185: \\( 185 / 9 \\approx 20 \\) users  \n   - **Cannot reach >100 collaborators.**\n\n3. **PREMIUM** \u2013 10 $ per user/month  \n   - Max users on $185: \\( 185 / 10 = 18 \\) users  \n   - **Cannot reach >100 collaborators.**\n\n4. **PREMIUM + ATLASSIAN_GUARD** \u2013 14 $ per user/month  \n   - Max users on $185: \\( 185 / 14 \\approx 13 \\) users  \n   - **Cannot reach >100 collaborators.**\n\n5. **ENTERPRISE** \u2013 17.5 $ per user/month  \n   - Max users on $185: \\( 185 / 17.5 \\approx 10 \\) users  \n   - **Cannot reach >100 collaborators.**\n\nSo even on the **cheapest unlimited\u2011collaborators plan (STANDARD at 5 $/user)**, supporting **101 users** would cost:\n\n- \\( 101 \\times 5 = 505 \\) USD/month\n\n\u2026which is **well above** your $185 monthly budget.\n\n---\n\n## 3. What *is* possible within $185/month?\n\nFor context, if you keep the $185/month total budget, the **maximum number of collaborators you can fully license** on each plan is approximately:\n\n- **STANDARD**: up to **37** users  \n- **STANDARD + ATLASSIAN_GUARD (SSO via Atlassian Guard)**: up to **20** users  \n- **PREMIUM** (advanced views, dashboards, etc.): up to **18** users  \n- **PREMIUM + ATLASSIAN_GUARD**: up to **13** users  \n- **ENTERPRISE** (SSO included, unlimited workspaces, org\u2011wide controls, 24/7 admin support): up to **10** users  \n\nAll of these still have **no collaborator overage fees** (workspace collaborators are unlimited), but they **do not** get you to >100 licensed team members within $185.\n\n---\n\n## 4. Practical implication\n\nGiven the pricing data you provided:\n\n- **No Trello configuration can support collaborating with more than 100 team members for a total of $185/month or less without exceeding your budget.**\n\nTo meet the \u201c>100 team members\u201d goal, you would need to either:\n\n- **Increase the budget substantially** (e.g., expect at least 505 $/month for 101 people on STANDARD), or  \n- **Reduce the number of paid users** and rely on a smaller paid core plus free collaborators/guests, which Trello\u2019s actual billing rules may support but are **not modeled in this YAML**. For those nuances (e.g., single\u2011board guests being free), you\u2019d need to check Trello\u2019s current documentation or talk to their sales team.\n\nIf you tell me roughly how many *active, paid* collaborators you\u2019re willing to support and whether you need features like SSO, advanced views, or enterprise controls, I can narrow down the most cost\u2011effective plan and approximate monthly spend.",

Total cost difference over 2021\u20132024\n\nBecause the gap is constant at **4 USD per person/month** throughout the period:\n\n- For any month between 2021 and 2024, **upgrading from Pro to Business costs an additional 4 USD per active user for that month.**\n- Over any span of months in that timeframe, the **total extra cost** of being on Business instead of Pro is:\n\n\\[\n\\text{Total extra cost} = 4\\ \\text{USD} \\times (\\text{number of users}) \\times (\\text{number of months on Business instead of Pro})\n\\]\n\nExamples (just to illustrate the formula):\n\n- **Per user, per year:**  \n  4 USD/month \u00d7 12 months = **48 USD extra per user per year.**\n- **If you had 10 users for 24 months on Business instead of Pro (anywhere between 2021\u20132024):**  \n  4 \u00d7 10 \u00d7 24 = **960 USD** extra over that period.\n\nSince the per-seat prices are unchanged between the 2021 and 2024 pricing snapshots, there\u2019s **no additional \u201ctime-based\u201d change** in the Pro vs Business cost difference\u2014only the straightforward 4 USD/user/month uplift whenever you choose Business over Pro.",

            "answer": "From the pricing data for both years, the **subscription price gap between Ecommerce Standard and Ecommerce Plus is the same in 2019 and 2023**.\n\n### 1. Plan prices in 2019\n\nFrom the 2019 pricing file:\n\n- **ECOMMERCE_STANDARD**\n  - `price: 42`\n  - `unit: site/month`\n- **ECOMMERCE_PLUS**\n  - `price: 84`\n  - `unit: site/month`\n\nSo in 2019 the upgrade cost is:\n\n- **84 \u2212 42 = 42 USD per site per month**\n- If paid month\u2011to\u2011month for a full year: **42 \u00d7 12 = 504 USD per year per site**\n\n(Webflow\u2019s annual billing multiplier in 2019 is `0.8`, so:\n- Standard annual: 42 \u00d7 12 \u00d7 0.8 = **403.20 USD**\n- Plus annual: 84 \u00d7 12 \u00d7 0.8 = **806.40 USD**\n- Annual *difference*: **403.20 USD per year per site**  \n  \u2014 still just the monthly difference \u00d7 12 \u00d7 0.8.)\n\n### 2. Plan prices in 2023\n\nFrom the 2023 pricing file:\n\n- **ECOMMERCE_STANDARD**\n  - `price: 42`\n  - `unit: site/month`\n- **ECOMMERCE_PLUS**\n  - `price: 84`\n  - `unit: site/month`\n\nAgain, the upgrade cost is:\n\n- **84 \u2212 42 = 42 USD per site per month**\n- If paid month\u2011to\u2011month for a full year: **504 USD per year per site**\n\n(Annual billing multiplier in 2023 is `0.85`, so:\n- Standard annual: 42 \u00d7 12 \u00d7 0.85 = **428.40 USD**\n- Plus annual: 84 \u00d7 12 \u00d7 0.85 = **856.80 USD**\n- Annual *difference*: **428.40 USD per year per site**.)\n\n### 3. \u201cTotal cost difference\u201d over the 2019\u20132023 timeframe\n\nBecause the **per\u2011month price gap is constant at 42 USD** in both the 2019 and 2023 pricebooks, the total extra subscription spend from upgrading is simply:\n\n> **42 USD \u00d7 (number of months you\u2019re on Ecommerce Plus instead of Standard)** per site  \n\nFor example, if you had Plus instead of Standard for exactly 5 years (60 months), paid monthly the entire time, the extra subscription cost would be:\n\n- 42 \u00d7 60 = **2,520 USD per site**  \n\nI can\u2019t give a single exact \u201ctotal\u201d without knowing **how many months/years** you\u2019re counting and whether you used monthly or annual billing, but the rule is:\n\n- **Extra cost per month (2019\u20132023): 42 USD per site**\n- **Extra cost per full year (month\u2011to\u2011month): 504 USD per site**\n\n> Note: this is subscription fee only. Ecommerce Plus also changes economics via **0% transaction fee** (vs **2%** on Standard) and much higher limits (e.g., ecommerce items and staff accounts), which can offset or exceed the subscription difference if your sales volume is high.",

            "answer": "Here\u2019s the cost comparison using Tableau\u2019s own pricing snapshots for 2019 and 2021.\n\n### 1. Plan prices from the pricing files\n\nAll prices are per user per month in USD.\n\n**2019 pricing (version 2019\u201108\u201113)**  \n- Explorer: **42 $**  \n- Creator: **70 $**  \n- Upgrade premium (Creator \u2212 Explorer): **70 $ \u2212 42 $ = 28 $ per user/month**\n\n**2021 pricing (version 2021\u201111\u201129)**  \n- Explorer: **35 $**  \n- Creator: **70 $**  \n- Upgrade premium (Creator \u2212 Explorer): **70 $ \u2212 35 $ = 35 $ per user/month**\n\nSo:\n\n| Year | Explorer | Creator | Extra cost to upgrade |\n|------|----------|---------|------------------------|\n| 2019 | 42 $     | 70 $    | **28 $/user/month**    |\n| 2021 | 35 $     | 70 $    | **35 $/user/month**    |\n\nBetween 2019 and 2021, **the monthly upgrade premium increased by 7 $ per user** (from 28 $ to 35 $).\n\n### 2. \u201cTotal\u201d cost difference over the 2019\u20132021 timeframe\n\nBecause Tableau\u2019s prices are given per user per month, the total cost difference depends on how many months you\u2019re counting. Two useful interpretations:\n\n- **Per full year at each price point**  \n  - 2019: 28 $ \u00d7 12 months = **336 $/user/year** extra for Creator vs Explorer  \n  - 2021: 35 $ \u00d7 12 months = **420 $/user/year** extra for Creator vs Explorer  \n  - If you assume one full year at 2019 prices and one full year at 2021 prices, the **total additional cost** of staying on Creator instead of Explorer over those two years would be:  \n    **336 $ + 420 $ = 756 $ per user**.\n\n- **For any custom duration**  \n  - 2019 portion: `28 $ \u00d7 (number of 2019 months)`  \n  - 2021 portion: `35 $ \u00d7 (number of 2021 months)`  \n  - Total extra cost of upgrading to Creator vs remaining on Explorer over your exact 2019\u20132021 timeframe is:  \n    \\[\n    \\text{Total extra} = 28 \\$ \\times M_{2019} + 35 \\$ \\times M_{2021}\n    \\]\n    where \\(M_{2019}\\) and \\(M_{2021}\\) are how many months fall under each pricing snapshot.\n\n### 3. What you pay more *for* when upgrading to Creator\n\nUsing Tableau\u2019s plan descriptions:\n\n- **Explorer** (\u201cExplore trusted data and answer your own questions faster with full self-service analytics\u201d) lets you:\n  - Interact with dashboards/visualizations\n  - Download full data\n  - Edit existing workbooks/visualizations\n  - Author from existing, curated data sources\n  - Manage content and user permissions (server/site level)\n\n- **Creator** (\u201cDiscover insights with a powerful suite of products that support your end\u2011to\u2011end analytics workflow\u201d) adds capabilities like:\n  - Connecting to **new** data sources (not just existing published ones)\n  - Creating and publishing **new data sources**\n  - Building **new data flows** (data prep) and editing/exporting them\n  - In 2019: additional server administration rights; in 2021: same core authoring/data\u2011prep set\n\nSo the quantified cost difference over 2019\u20132021 is:\n\n- **28 $/user/month extra in 2019**\n- **35 $/user/month extra in 2021**\n- Under the simple assumption of 12 months at each price point, **756 $/user total extra** to upgrade to Creator instead of staying on Explorer across those two years.",

Premium further adds things like unlimited contacts/audiences/seats, more onboarding sessions, and phone support, which is why the price jumps sharply.\n\n---\n\n## 3. \u201cTotal\u201d cost difference across 2019 and 2024\n\nBecause the dataset only gives **two snapshots** (late 2019 and mid\u20112024), we don\u2019t have exact month\u2011by\u2011month pricing for every year in between. So I can\u2019t precisely compute the cost difference for *every month from 2019 through 2024* without guessing.\n\nWhat I **can** state precisely from the data:\n\n- **2019 (1 year at that price):** Premium costs **3,408.12 USD** more than Standard.  \n- **2024 (1 year at that price, \u2264500 contacts):** Premium costs **3,960 USD** more than Standard.  \n\nIf you imagine using each snapshot price for **one full year** (one year at 2019 rates + one year at 2024 rates), then over those two years:\n\n- Total additional cost of Premium vs Standard  \n  = 3,408.12 + 3,960  \n  = **7,368.12 USD more** for Premium than Standard.\n\n---\n\n### Important assumptions and limits\n\n- For **2019**, prices are flat monthly amounts (no per\u2011contact scaling shown in the YAML).\n- For **2024**, the quoted prices are for the **500\u2011contact tier**; at higher contact counts, actual Premium and Standard prices would both be higher, but that data isn\u2019t included here.\n- We only have pricing for **one date in 2019** and **one date in 2024**, so any multi\u2011year total beyond \u201cone year at each snapshot price\u201d would be speculative.\n\nIf you tell me how many months you want to model (e.g., \u201c36 months from Jan 2022\u2013Dec 2024\u201d) and what contact tier you\u2019re on, I can scale these per\u2011month differences accordingly.",

SHOPIFY plan + SHOPIFY_POS_PRO add-on\n\n- **Configuration:**  \n  - Base plan: `SHOPIFY`  \n  - Add-on: `SHOPIFY_POS_PRO`\n- **Total price:** `168 $` per user/month  \n  - This matches the component pricing from the YAML:\n    - `SHOPIFY`: 79 $\n    - `SHOPIFY_POS_PRO` add-on: 89 $\n    - **79 $ + 89 $ = 168 $**, still under your 173 $ limit.\n\n- **Why it qualifies:**\n  - Uses the same `SHOPIFY` base plan, so it inherits:\n    - `fastCheckout`\n    - `uspsPriorityMailCubicPricing`\n    - All the Shopify Shipping and reporting features listed above.\n  - The `SHOPIFY_POS_PRO` add-on adds `shopifyPosPro`:\n    - \u201cRun your brick-and-mortar business with powerful tools built for omnichannel selling.\u201d\n\n- **Usage limits & features:**\n  - Same core limits as SHOPIFY (5 staff accounts, 5 locations, 0.72 shipping discount rate, 0.01 third-party processor fee).\n  - Adds advanced POS functionality for physical stores while keeping your total under 173 $.\n\n---\n\n### Why there are only these two options\n\nFrom the YAML:\n\n- `uspsPriorityMailCubicPricing: true` is only set on:\n  - `SHOPIFY` (79 $)\n  - `ADVANCED_SHOPIFY` (299 $)\n- `BASIC_SHOPIFY` does **not** enable `uspsPriorityMailCubicPricing`.\n- `ADVANCED_SHOPIFY` is priced at **299 $**, and any configuration based on it would exceed your 173 $ limit.\n\nSince `fastCheckout` is enabled by default on all plans, the binding constraint is **having `uspsPriorityMailCubicPricing` while staying under 173 $**. That leaves exactly:\n\n1. `SHOPIFY` at **79 $**\n2. `SHOPIFY` + `SHOPIFY_POS_PRO` at **168 $**",

            "answer": "Based on the Slack pricing data you provided, **there is no configuration that both:**\n\n1. Includes **priority support** and **Slack AI**, **and**\n2. Has a **published price** that can be verified as **< 175 USD per user/month**.\n\nHere\u2019s why.\n\n---\n\n## 1. Where the two required features are available\n\nFrom the YAML:\n\n- **prioritySupport**\n  - Only included in the base plan **ENTERPRISE_GRID**:\n    - `plans.ENTERPRISE_GRID.features.prioritySupport.value: true`\n  - Not present in **FREE**, **PRO**, or **BUSINESS_PLUS**.\n\n- **slackAI**\n  - Only provided via the **Slack AI add-on**:\n    - `addOns.slackAI.features.slackAI.value: true`\n  - That add-on is available for:\n    - `PRO`\n    - `BUSINESS_PLUS`\n    - `ENTERPRISE_GRID`\n\nSo, feature-wise, the *only* configuration that gives you **both** priority support and Slack AI is:\n\n> **ENTERPRISE_GRID base plan + Slack AI add-on**\n\nNo other plan + add-on combo can satisfy both features:\n\n- **PRO + Slack AI** \u2192 Slack AI yes, *prioritySupport no*\n- **BUSINESS_PLUS + Slack AI** \u2192 Slack AI yes, *prioritySupport no*\n- **FREE** \u2192 Neither.\n\n---\n\n## 2. Why the optimizer found zero options under $175\n\nThe tool was asked to find subscriptions with:\n\n- `maxPrice: 175`\n- `features: [\"prioritySupport\", \"slackAI\"]`\n\nResult:\n\n```json\n\"subscriptions\": [],\n\"cardinality\": 0\n```\n\nThis is because of the pricing entries:\n\n- **ENTERPRISE_GRID** base plan:\n  - `price: \"Contact Sales\"` (no numeric price)\n- **Slack AI add-on**:\n  - `price: \"Contact Sales\"` (no numeric price)\n\nSince both the only suitable base plan (ENTERPRISE_GRID) and the Slack AI add-on are priced as **\u201cContact Sales\u201d** rather than a numeric USD value, the solver cannot determine whether their price is below **175 USD/user/month**. It therefore **cannot include** this configuration in a \u201c\u2264 175\u201d search and returns **zero** matches.\n\nBy contrast, the numeric prices we *do* have are:\n\n- **FREE**: `0 USD per user/month` \u2014 but no Slack AI, no prioritySupport.\n- **PRO**: `8.75 USD per user/month` \u2014 Slack AI add-on available, but no prioritySupport.\n- **BUSINESS_PLUS**: `15 USD per user/month` \u2014 Slack AI add-on available, but no prioritySupport.\n\nNone of these have both required features.\n\n---\n\n## 3. Answering your question directly\n\nInterpreting your $175 cap as **per user per month** (the unit used in this file):\n\n- **Configurations that *functionally* provide both `prioritySupport` and `slackAI`**:\n  - **ENTERPRISE_GRID + Slack AI add-on**\n- **But:** both parts show `price: Contact Sales`, so from this dataset we **cannot confirm** that their price is **< 175 USD/user/month**, and the optimizer cannot treat them as being under your budget.\n\nSo, strictly grounded in this pricing data:\n\n> **There are no Slack configurations with *both* priority support and Slack AI that have a published numeric price under 175 USD per user/month.**  \n> The only configuration that has both features (Enterprise Grid + Slack AI add-on) uses \u201cContact Sales\u201d pricing, so you would need to confirm the actual price with Slack Sales.\n\nIf you let me know how many users you\u2019re planning for, I can also map out your approximate spend for the other plans (PRO / BUSINESS_PLUS + Slack AI) so you can compare them to your $175 budget on a per-workspace basis, even though they don\u2019t include prioritySupport.",

            "answer": "Yes. Based on the pricing data you provided and a \u201cdaily team task management\u201d use case, **Trello Enterprise is more cost\u2011effective than Wrike Business.**\n\n---\n\n## 1. Price comparison\n\nFrom the YAML:\n\n**Trello \u2013 Enterprise plan**\n\n- `price: 20.83`\n- `unit: user/month`\n\nSo Trello Enterprise costs **20.83 USD per user per month**.\n\n**Wrike \u2013 Business plan**\n\n- `price: 124`\n- `unit: 5 user/month`\n\nThis is **124 USD for 5 users per month**, i.e.:\n\n- 124 \u00f7 5 = **24.8 USD per user per month**\n\nWrike also has an add\u2011on:\n\n- `extraUsersForBUSINESS`  \n  - `price: 24.8`  \n  - `unit: user/month`\n\nwhich confirms the **per\u2011user price of 24.8 USD**.\n\n**Purely on price, Trello Enterprise (~20.83 USD) is about 16% cheaper per user than Wrike Business (24.8 USD).**  \nThis price gap is the same at almost any team size, since both scale linearly per user.\n\n---\n\n## 2. Are you getting what you need for \u201cdaily team task management\u201d?\n\n### What Trello Enterprise gives you that matters here\n\nFrom the Trello YAML, Enterprise includes:\n\nCore task features (good for daily task management):\n\n- Boards, lists, cards, file attachments (`personalBoards`, `teamBoards`, `cards`, `lists`, `fileAttachments`)\n- Power\u2011Ups (integrations and extra views like calendars and custom fields) with **no Power\u2011Up limit**:\n  - `powerUpsLimit: value: .inf`\n  - `customFields`, `calendarView`, `mapView`, `voting`, `appIntegrations`, etc.\n- Automation by Butler:\n  - Card/board buttons, rules, scheduled commands\n  - In Enterprise, these have **effectively unlimited runs/commands**:\n    - `butlerCommandsBoardButtonLimit: value: .inf`\n    - `butlerCommandsCardButtonLimit: value: .inf`\n    - `butlerCommandsRulesLimit: value: .inf`\n    - `butlerCommandsRunTeamLimit: value: .inf`\n    - `butlerCommandsRunUserLimit: value: .inf`\n- Per\u2011file attachment limit of **250 MB** (`fileAttachmentsLimit: value: 250`), which is ample for typical docs.\n\nEnterprise\u2011level admin & security (relevant if you\u2019re a larger org):\n\n- `singleSignOn: value: true`\n- `2factorAuthentication: value: true`\n- Advanced admin permissions, domain\u2011restricted invites, deactivating members\n- Organization\u2011wide permissions and visibility; power\u2011up and attachment restrictions\n- Personalized onboarding and public board management\n\nFor **day\u2011to\u2011day team task tracking** (boards, tasks, assignments, due dates, simple automations and integrations), Trello Enterprise clearly covers more than the basics and adds strong admin/security controls.\n\n### What Wrike Business adds (and when it matters)\n\nWrike Business is positioned (per YAML description) as:\n\n> \u201cRobust work management with customization & exec reporting\u201d\n\nKey features it includes:\n\n- Structured project management:\n  - `subtaskManagement`\n  - `ganttChart`\n  - `calendars`\n  - `requestForms`\n  - `taskAndProjectApproval`\n- Measurement & reporting:\n  - `timeTracking`\n  - `sharedRealTimeReportsWithScheduledNotifications`\n  - `reportTemplates`\n  - `graphicalAnalytics`\n- Governance & customization:\n  - `customFields`\n  - `customWorkflows`\n  - `userGroupsAndPermissions`\n  - `salesForceIntegration`\n  - `brandedWorkspace`\n- Storage:\n  - `useStorage: value: 50` GB per account\n  - `useStorageAccount: value: 15` GB/month (for video uploads)\n\nThese are powerful for **formal project management, executive reporting, time tracking and approvals workflows**. If your \u201cdaily tasks\u201d actually sit inside complex, deadline\u2011driven projects with dependencies, heavy reporting needs, and billable hours, those extras can justify paying more.\n\n---\n\n## 3. Cost\u2011effectiveness for your stated use case\n\nGiven your description:\n\n> \u201ca team that needs to managing team tasks on a daily basis\u201d\n\nThat usually means:\n\n- Creating/assigning tasks\n- Managing backlogs/boards\n- Tracking statuses and due dates\n- Collaborating via comments and attachments\n- Some automation and integrations\n\nFor that scope:\n\n- **Trello Enterprise**:\n  - **Cheaper** per user (20.83 vs 24.8 USD).\n  - Fully covers core task management and collaboration.\n  - Provides strong automation (Butler) and SSO/admin controls.\n- **Wrike Business**:\n  - **More expensive** per user.\n  - Offers advanced project management, analytics, approvals, and time tracking that you may not actually need for \u201csimple daily task management.\u201d\n\nSo, **for straightforward daily team task tracking, Trello Enterprise is more cost\u2011effective**: it\u2019s lower cost and still comfortably meets (and exceeds) the functional needs implied by your use case.\n\nWrike Business only becomes *more* cost\u2011effective if:\n\n- You actively need Gantt charts, formal approvals, extensive reporting/analytics, and time tracking; and\n- Those features meaningfully improve outcomes enough to justify the ~4 USD/user/month premium.\n\n---\n\n**Bottom line:**  \nFor a typical team focused on everyday task management rather than heavy project governance and analytics, **Trello Enterprise is more cost\u2011effective than Wrike Business** according to the pricing and features in your YAML data.",

            "answer": "No\u2014given the use case of **managing complex tasks on a daily basis**, HyperContext Pro is cheaper but **not** more cost\u2011effective than ClickUp Business Plus in most realistic scenarios.\n\n---\n\n## 1. Direct price comparison\n\nFrom the pricing data you provided:\n\n- **HyperContext \u2013 PRO**\n  - Price: **7 USD per person/month**\n  - Description: *\u201cBest for managers with too much on their plate.\u201d*\n- **ClickUp \u2013 BUSINESS_PLUS**\n  - Price: **29 USD per member/month**\n  - Description: *\u201cBest for multiple teams.\u201d*\n\nFor the same team size, HyperContext Pro costs about **\u00bc** of ClickUp Business Plus:\n\n- 10 people: HyperContext = **70 USD/mo** vs ClickUp = **290 USD/mo**\n- 50 people: HyperContext = **350 USD/mo** vs ClickUp = **1,450 USD/mo**\n\nPurely on subscription price, HyperContext Pro is clearly cheaper.\n\n---\n\n## 2. Fit for \u201ccomplex tasks on a daily basis\u201d\n\nThe key is whether HyperContext can reasonably **replace** what ClickUp Business Plus does for complex work.\n\n### What HyperContext Pro is optimized for\n\nHyperContext (especially the PRO plan) is fundamentally a **meeting and manager productivity tool**, not a full project/task management system.\n\nCore strengths (from the YAML):\n\n- One\u2011on\u2011one and team meetings, meeting notes, agendas, and archives\n- Calendar integrations (Google Calendar, Outlook, Google Meet, Microsoft Teams)\n- **PRO-only upgrades**:\n  - `realTimeCollaboration`: true\n  - `publicMeetingScratchpad`, `nextSteps` (action items), `favoriteItems`\n  - `meetingInsights`, `itemVoting`\n  - `customPersonalAgendaTemplates`\n  - `zapier` integration\n- Generous usage:\n  - `storageLimit`: **250 GB** (vs 2 GB on Basic)\n  - Essentially unlimited meeting search\n\nWhat it **does not** provide (especially on PRO; some appear only on BUSINESS):\n\n- No real **task hierarchy/views** comparable to boards, Gantt charts, workload views, etc.\n- No explicit **dependencies**, sprints, or rich project dashboards.\n- Goals/milestones/OKR tooling (`goalSetting`, `milestones`, `okrExampleLibrary`) are available only on **BUSINESS**, not PRO.\n\nIn practice, HyperContext Pro is excellent for:\n- Running structured meetings\n- Capturing and lightly tracking \u201cnext steps\u201d\n- Keeping managers organized\n\n\u2026but it is **not** a full-fledged environment for managing complex, interdependent task workflows across a team.\n\n### What ClickUp Business Plus is optimized for\n\nClickUp is explicitly a **work and task management platform**, and BUSINESS_PLUS is a high-end tier for multiple teams.\n\nRelevant capabilities (beyond the always\u2011on ClickUp basics like `tasks`, `dependencies`, `customFields`, `sprints`, `dashboards`, etc.):\n\n- Rich **views for complex work**:\n  - `listView`, `boardView`, `calendarView`, `ganttView`, `timelineView`, `workloadView`, `tableView`, `mapView`, `mindMaps`, `docView`, `chatView`\n- Advanced automation and scale:\n  - `automations`: true with **25,000 automations/month** (`useAutomations`: 25000)\n  - `apiCalls`: 1000 calls/minute (`useApiCalls`: 1000)\n- Team- and portfolio-level control:\n  - `teams`, `teamSharing`: true\n  - `portfolios`, `portfoliosPermissions`\n  - `dashboardsWidget`: FULL, with effectively unlimited dashboards\n- Time & workload management:\n  - `timeTracking`, `timeTrackingNotesLabelsAndBillableTime`, `timeSheets`\n  - `granularTimeEstimates`\n  - `workloadViewCustomCapacityAndAdditionalGroups`\n  - `workInProgressLimits`\n- Governance & security:\n  - `customPermissions`, `customRoles` (with `useCustomRoles`: 1)\n  - `googleSSO`, `smsTwoFactorAuthentication`, `requireTwoFactorAuthentication`\n  - `prioritySupport`\n\nThese features collectively support **daily management of complex, multi\u2011step, cross\u2011team work** with dependencies, automation, resource planning, and reporting.\n\n---\n\n## 3. Cost\u2011effectiveness for your stated use case\n\nFor **\u201ca team that needs to managing complex tasks on a daily basis\u201d**:\n\n- **HyperContext Pro**\n  - Pros: Very low cost, excellent for meetings and lightweight \u201cnext steps\u201d, strong calendar/communication integrations.\n  - Cons: Lacks core project\u2011management constructs (boards, Gantt, workload, dependencies at scale, robust dashboards, heavy automation).\n  - Result: You\u2019d almost certainly need **another tool** to handle serious task/project management, which erodes its apparent cost advantage.\n\n- **ClickUp Business Plus**\n  - Pros: Designed specifically as a robust work OS; includes almost everything you\u2019d expect for complex task & project management across multiple teams.\n  - Cons: Significantly higher price per user.\n  - Result: Higher upfront cost, but far more likely to **replace multiple tools** (PM, time tracking, reporting) and reduce coordination overhead.\n\nSo while **HyperContext Pro is cheaper per seat (7 USD vs 29 USD)**, it does **not** deliver equivalent functionality for complex daily task management. Once you factor in:\n\n- The likely need for an additional PM tool alongside HyperContext, and/or  \n- The productivity loss from forcing complex work into a meeting\u2011centric app,\n\nClickUp Business Plus becomes **more cost\u2011effective for that specific use case**, because it actually fits the job.\n\n---\n\n### Bottom line\n\n- **If your primary need is complex, day\u2011to\u2011day task and project management** across a team or multiple teams:  \n  \u2192 **ClickUp Business Plus is more cost\u2011effective**, despite the higher price, because it consolidates and automates far more of that work.\n\n- **If your work is relatively simple and your main pain is running better meetings and tracking light action items** (with task complexity handled elsewhere):  \n  \u2192 **HyperContext Pro is financially cheaper** and can be very cost\u2011efficient as a meeting/manager tool\u2014but *not* as a replacement for ClickUp Business Plus for complex task management.",

Price comparison (Enterprise plans)\n\n**ClickUp \u2013 ENTERPRISE**\n\n- Listed price: **\u201cContact Sales\u201d** (no numeric price given).\n- Lower tier for reference:\n  - **BUSINESS:** **19 USD / member / month**\n\nBecause ENTERPRISE sits above BUSINESS, its price is **at least** 19 USD per member per month, and realistically higher.\n\n---\n\n**Trello \u2013 ENTERPRISE**\n\n- Listed price: **20.83 USD / user / month**\n- Billing multipliers:\n  - `billing.monthly: 1.0`\n  - `billing.annual: 0.7792`\n\nSo if you pay annually, the effective Enterprise price is:\n\n> 20.83 \u00d7 0.7792 \u2248 **16.23 USD / user / month** (effective)\n\nThis is already **cheaper than ClickUp BUSINESS at 19 USD** / member / month, and almost certainly cheaper than ClickUp ENTERPRISE.\n\n**Implication:**  \nOn *sticker price per user*, especially with annual billing, **Trello Enterprise is likely cheaper than ClickUp Enterprise**.\n\n---\n\n## 2. Remote\u2011work\u2011relevant features on Enterprise\n\nBoth tools cover the basics needed for daily remote work:\n\n- Shared workspaces/boards\n- Tasks/cards\n- File attachments\n- Integrations with other tools\n- Security features suitable for distributed teams\n\n### ClickUp ENTERPRISE \u2013 key strengths for remote work\n\nFrom the YAML, Enterprise includes everything in lower tiers plus:\n\n- **Advanced security and access:**\n  - `twoFactorAuthentication: true`\n  - `googleSingleSignOn: true`\n  - `singleSignOn: true`\n  - `advancedPermissions: true`\n- **Enterprise governance & compliance:**\n  - `contractReview: true`\n  - `hipaaCompliance: true`\n- **Collaboration & management features:**\n  - `guests`, `extraGuests: true` (external collaborators)\n  - `workload: true` (capacity/workload view)\n  - `reporting: true`\n  - `goals`, `goalFolders`, `portfolio`, `customFields: true`\n  - `privateViews`, `protectedViews`, `defaultViews: true`\n- **Enterprise support:**\n  - `customOnboarding: true`\n  - `dedicatedSuccessManager: true`\n- **Technical scale:**\n  - `api: true` with `increasedApiLimit: true`\n\n**What this means for remote work:**  \nClickUp Enterprise is an \u201call\u2011in\u2011one work OS\u201d: tasks, goals, portfolios, workload management, advanced permissions, and compliance features (HIPAA) are bundled together. For a distributed team running complex projects and needing compliance plus high\u2011touch onboarding/support, this is high value.\n\n---\n\n### Trello ENTERPRISE \u2013 key strengths for remote work\n\nFrom the YAML, Enterprise includes:\n\n- **Board\u2011based collaboration:**\n  - `personalBoards: true`, `teamBoards: true`\n  - Unlimited boards and very high usage limits:\n    - `teamBoardsLimit: .inf`\n    - `powerUpsLimit: .inf`\n- **Power\u2011Ups and integrations:**\n  - `powerUps: true`\n  - `appIntegrations: true` (Slack, Google Drive, etc.)\n  - `customFields`, `calendarView`, `mapView`, `voting`, etc.\n- **Automation (Butler) at scale:**\n  - `butlerScheduledCommands: true`\n  - `butlerCommandAdministration: true`\n  - `butlerEmailNotifications: true`\n  - `butlerHttpRequests: true`\n  - Unlimited or very high limits:\n    - `butlerCommandsBoardButtonLimit: .inf`\n    - `butlerCommandsCardButtonLimit: .inf`\n    - `butlerCommandsRulesLimit: .inf`\n    - `butlerCommandsRunTeamLimit: .inf`\n    - `butlerCommandsRunUserLimit: .inf`\n- **Security & org\u2011level control (crucial for remote teams):**\n  - `2factorAuthentication: true`\n  - `singleSignOn: true`\n  - `googleAppsSignOn: true`\n  - `advancedAdminPermissions: true`\n  - `domainRestrictedInvites: true`\n  - `deactivateMembers: true`\n  - `powerUpAdministration: true`\n  - `attachmentRestrictions: true`\n  - `organizationWidePermissions: true`\n  - `organizationVisibleBoards: true`\n  - `publicBoardManagement: true`\n- **Support & onboarding:**\n  - `prioritySupport: true`\n  - `personalizedOnboarding: true`\n  - `simpleDataExport: true` (JSON/CSV)\n\n**What this means for remote work:**  \nTrello Enterprise is a **highly scalable Kanban/board system** with strong automation (Butler) and robust admin/security controls. It\u2019s excellent for daily remote coordination across many boards and teams, especially if your workflows are well\u2011expressed as boards, lists, and cards.\n\n---\n\n## 3. So: is ClickUp Enterprise more cost\u2011effective than Trello Enterprise?\n\n**On pure price per user:**  \n- Trello Enterprise: **20.83 USD/user/month** (\u2248 **16.23 USD** effective if billed annually).\n- ClickUp Enterprise: **no published price**; but since **BUSINESS is 19 USD/member/month**, Enterprise will be **\u2265 19 USD**, and typically higher.\n\nGiven that Trello Enterprise\u2019s annual effective price (~16.23 USD) is **already lower than ClickUp BUSINESS**, it is very unlikely that ClickUp ENTERPRISE is cheaper per seat.  \n**So purely on license cost, Trello Enterprise is more cost\u2011effective.**\n\n**On value for a generic remote team:**\n\n- If your remote team:\n  - Primarily needs **shared boards, cards, checklists, file sharing, and automations** for daily coordination,\n  - Does **not** require HIPAA or deeply structured goal/portfolio/workload management,\n  \n  then **Trello Enterprise** is likely **more cost\u2011effective**:\n  - Lower effective price (especially annually).\n  - Strong remote\u2011friendly automation and admin features.\n  - SSO, 2FA, and org\u2011wide controls are already included.\n\n- If your remote team:\n  - Runs **complex, multi\u2011project programs**,\n  - Needs **workload views, goals, portfolios, advanced reporting**, and possibly **HIPAA compliance**,\n  - Wants **custom onboarding and a dedicated success manager** baked into the subscription,\n  - Intends to **replace multiple tools** (project management + goals + reporting + some compliance tooling) with a single platform,\n\n  then **ClickUp Enterprise can be more cost\u2011effective at the *stack* level**, even if its per\u2011user license is higher, because it consolidates functionality that you might otherwise pay for separately.\n\n---\n\n## 4. Practical takeaway\n\n- For a typical team simply \u201cfacilitating remote work on a daily basis\u201d (shared boards, tasks, automation, SSO, and security) and **not chasing very advanced PM or compliance**,  \n  \u2192 **Trello Enterprise is usually the more cost\u2011effective choice** given the known pricing.\n\n- ClickUp Enterprise becomes \u201cmore cost\u2011effective\u201d only if:\n  - You **need** its advanced enterprise features (workload, goals/portfolios, HIPAA, dedicated success manager, etc.), **and**\n  - Those features let you **avoid buying other tools** or custom solutions.\n\nTo make a final decision, you\u2019d need an actual **ClickUp Enterprise quote** for your team size and compare:\n\n> (ClickUp Enterprise cost per month)  \n> **vs.**  \n> (Trello Enterprise cost per month + cost of any additional tools Trello would require that ClickUp would replace).",

            "answer": "MailChimp PREMIUM at **299 USD/month** is the more cost\u2011effective choice for a team launching **daily marketing campaigns**, for two main reasons: capacity and fit for purpose.\n\n---\n\n### 1. Pricing & capacity\n\n**MailChimp \u2013 PREMIUM plan**\n\n- **Price:** `299` USD `/month`\n- **Monthly email limit:** `3000000` emails (`monthlyEmailSends: 3000000`)\n- **Contacts limit:** `200000` contacts\n- **Seats:** unlimited (`seatsLimit: .inf`)\n- Designed and described as:  \n  > \u201cAdvanced features for pros who need more customization.\u201d\n\nEven if you send hundreds of thousands of emails per month, PREMIUM easily covers daily campaigns.\n\n---\n\n**Trustmary \u2013 Full, LIGHT plan**\n\n- **Price:** `\"Contact Sales\"` (no concrete number in the pricing data)\n- **Monthly email limit:** `1000` emails/month (`emailsLimit: 1000`)\n- **Forms limit:** `2` forms\n- **Users limit:** `2`\n- No additional features or limits are defined for LIGHT, so it uses the **default** limits above.\n\nFor **daily campaigns**, 1000 emails/month is only ~33 emails per day. That is not sufficient for a typical marketing team unless your list is extremely small.\n\nBecause of that limit, Trustmary LIGHT is effectively **incapable** of supporting daily marketing campaigns at any normal scale, regardless of its eventual price.\n\n---\n\n### 2. Feature fit for \u201cmarketing campaigns\u201d\n\n**MailChimp PREMIUM** (from the YAML) is a full marketing platform:\n\n- Core outbound marketing:\n  - `emailMarketing` (bulk campaigns)\n  - `landingPages`, `shoppableLandingPages`\n  - `facebookAds`, `instagramAds`\n  - `socialPosting`, `socialPostScheduling`\n  - `retargetingAds`\n- Automation and campaign orchestration:\n  - `singleStepAutomations`, `classicAutomationsBuilder`\n  - `customerJourneyBuilder`, `multipleStartingPoints`, `branchingPoints`, `prebuiltJourneys`\n  - `behaviorBasedAutomationSeries`\n- Optimization & personalization:\n  - `advancedSegmentation`\n  - `abTesting`, `multivarianteTesting`\n  - `dynamicContent`\n  - `sendTimeOptimization`, `deliveryByTimezone`\n  - Predictive features (`predictedDemographics`, `customerLifetimeValue`, `purchaseLikelihood`, `lookalikeAudienceFinder`)\n- Reporting & support:\n  - `comparativeReporting`\n  - `24/7EmailSupport`, `24/7ChatSupport`, `phoneSupport`\n\nThese are all directly relevant to **setting up, optimizing, and scaling daily marketing campaigns**.\n\n---\n\n**Trustmary \u2013 Full (LIGHT)** is fundamentally a **feedback/review tool**, not a bulk marketing platform:\n\nDefault features include things like:\n\n- `nps`, `csat`, `collectingFeedback`, `forms`, `standardForms`\n- `collectWithEmail` (email surveys, not bulk promos)\n- `shareablelink`, `qrCode`\n- `textReviews`\n- `emailSupport`\n\nMost advanced features (e.g., `customForms`, `importingContacts`, `smartContactLists`, `embedReviewsToWebsite`, social proof popups) are only in higher plans (PLUS/ENTERPRISE), and even those focus on **NPS, CSAT, reviews, and website embeds**, not large-scale outbound marketing campaigns.\n\nSo even aside from price, Trustmary LIGHT is **not a functional substitute** for MailChimp when your goal is daily marketing campaigns.\n\n---\n\n### 3. Cost\u2011effectiveness conclusion\n\n- **We have a concrete price for MailChimp PREMIUM**: `299` USD/month for up to `3000000` marketing emails plus a full suite of campaign, automation, and optimization tools.\n- **We do NOT have a concrete price for Trustmary LIGHT** (`\"Contact Sales\"`), but:\n  - Its **emails limit is only 1000/month**, which makes daily campaigns impractical.\n  - Its features are aimed at **surveys and testimonials**, not ongoing outbound campaign management.\n\nGiven your requirement\u2014**launching marketing campaigns on a daily basis**\u2014Trustmary LIGHT cannot realistically satisfy the use case at any scale, so it is **not cost\u2011effective as a primary campaign tool**.  \n\n**MailChimp PREMIUM is the more cost\u2011effective option** because it:\n\n1. Actually supports high\u2011frequency campaigns (up to 3,000,000 emails/month).\n2. Provides the campaign, automation, and optimization features you need to run and improve those daily campaigns.\n\n---\n\n**Practical note:**  \nIf you don\u2019t need all of PREMIUM\u2019s advanced features, the **STANDARD** plan at `14.99` USD `/month` (with `1200000` emails/month) might be even more cost\u2011effective for daily campaigns than PREMIUM; but between **MailChimp PREMIUM** and **Trustmary LIGHT**, MailChimp PREMIUM is clearly the appropriate and more cost\u2011effective choice for your stated needs.",

            "answer": "You can\u2019t strictly tell from the provided pricing data which Enterprise plan is cheaper, because **both Jira Enterprise and Wrike Enterprise are listed as \u201cContact Sales\u201d** (custom quotes).  \n\nHowever, based on:\n\n- the **published non\u2011enterprise prices**, and  \n- the **feature sets for a code\u2011repository\u2013centric team**,  \n\n**Jira Enterprise is likely to be more cost\u2011effective than Wrike Enterprise for a team managing code repositories daily**, assuming broadly comparable enterprise discounts.\n\nBelow is how that conclusion follows from the YAML you provided.\n\n---\n\n## 1. What the pricing data actually tells us\n\nFrom the archived 2020 pricing files:\n\n### Jira (2020-11-29)\n\nPlans and prices (USD, per user/month):\n\n- **FREE**: `0`\n- **STANDARD**: `7`\n- **PREMIUM**: `14`\n- **ENTERPRISE**: `Contact Sales` (no numeric price)\n\nKey Enterprise usage limits:\n\n- `usersLimit`: `20000`\n- `sitesLimit`: `.inf` (effectively unlimited Jira sites)\n- `storageLimit`: `.inf` (effectively unlimited storage)\n\n### Wrike (2020-11-24)\n\nPlans and prices (USD, per user/month):\n\n- **FREE**: `0`\n- **PROFESSIONAL**: `9.8`\n- **BUSINESS**: `24.8`\n- **ENTERPRISE**: `Contact Sales` (no numeric price)\n\nKey Enterprise usage limits:\n\n- `maxNumberOfUsers`: `10000000000` (effectively unlimited users)\n- `useStorage`: `100` GB\n- `useStorageAccount`: `15` GB/month for video uploads\n- `useAutomations`: `10000000000` actions (effectively unlimited automations)\n\n### Price pattern\n\nFrom these non\u2011enterprise tiers:\n\n- Jira STANDARD (`7`) < Wrike PROFESSIONAL (`9.8`)\n- Jira PREMIUM (`14`) << Wrike BUSINESS (`24.8`)\n\nSo for roughly comparable tiers, **Wrike is significantly more expensive per user** than Jira in the data you provided.\n\nWe do *not* have actual Enterprise prices for either (both are \u201cContact Sales\u201d), so we **cannot numerically prove** Jira Enterprise is cheaper. But the observable pattern is that *Jira is the lower\u2011cost platform at the published tiers*.\n\n---\n\n## 2. Features that matter for a team managing code repositories\n\nYour scenario is: *\u201ca team that needs to manage code repositories on a daily basis.\u201d* That usually means:\n\n- Developer\u2011centric workflows (issues \u2194 commits, pull requests, branches)\n- Agile boards and backlogs\n- Automation tied to code events\n- Integrations with Git platforms (Bitbucket, GitHub, GitLab, etc.)\n\n### Jira Enterprise \u2013 relevant items from the YAML\n\nCore agile/dev workflow:\n\n- `scrumAndKanbanBoards`: `true`\n- `backlog`: `true`\n- `agileReporting`: `true`\n- `customizableWorkflows`: `true`\n- `automation`: `true`\n\nEnterprise-only enhancements:\n\n- `advancedRoadmaps`: `true` \u2013 cross\u2011project planning for multiple repos/projects.\n- `globalAndMultiProjectAutomation`: `true` \u2013 cross\u2011project automations, useful when you have several repos/services.\n- `advancedPermissions`: `true` \u2013 fine\u2011grained control over who can change what.\n- `projectArchiving`: `true` \u2013 useful for large codebases and many old projects.\n\nIntegration and ecosystem:\n\n- `appsAndIntegrations`: `true`, with `integrationType: MARKETPLACE`  \n  \u2192 Jira can connect to code hosting and CI/CD tools via the Atlassian Marketplace. Many of those apps are specifically built for Git/Bitbucket/GitHub workflows.\n\nEnterprise governance & scale:\n\n- `atlassianAccess`: `true` (bundled in Enterprise; otherwise an add\u2011on that is also \u201cContact Sales\u201d) \u2013 central SSO/SCIM/security.\n- `dataResidency`: `true`\n- `ipAllowlisting`, `auditLogs`, `adminInsights`: `true`\n- `uptimeSLA`, `enterpriseSupport`, `orgLevelBilling`: `true`\n- Unlimited `sitesLimit` and `storageLimit`: `.inf`\n\nThese are directly aligned with large software/dev organizations: multiple Jira instances (sites), very large history of issues linked to code, and strict security and governance.\n\n### Wrike Enterprise \u2013 relevant items from the YAML\n\nCore work management:\n\n- Always\u2011on basics: `taskManagement`, `fileSharing`, `boardView`, etc.\n- Enterprise includes and extends all BUSINESS features:\n  - `customFields`, `customWorkflows`, `timeTracking`\n  - `ganttChart`, `calendars`, `requestForms`, `taskAndProjectApproval`\n  - `automationEngine`: `true`\n\nEnterprise\u2011grade security & control:\n\n- `activeDirectoryIntegration`: `true`\n- `singleSignOn`: `true`\n- `twoFactorVerification`: `true`\n- `passwordPolicies`: `true`\n- `itControlAdminPermissions`, `userAuditReports`, `networkAccess&CompliancePolicies`, `advancedUserAccessControls`: `true`\n- `businessIntelligenceIntegration`: `true`\n\nAdd\u2011ons (all \u201cContact Sales\u201d):\n\n- `wrikeIntegrate`: `true` \u2013 API/integration platform\n- `wrikeTwoWaySync`: `true`\n- Plus others (Resource, Proof, Publish, Analyze, Lock), all priced \u201cContact Sales\u201d\n\nFrom the YAML, Wrike is a **general work management and project platform** with strong automation/reporting and enterprise security. There is **no explicit mention of Git/code\u2011repository features**. To deeply integrate code repositories, you\u2019d typically rely on:\n\n- the generic `automationEngine`, and/or  \n- API\u2011based add\u2011ons like `wrikeIntegrate` or `wrikeTwoWaySync` (each with its own \u201cContact Sales\u201d price).\n\nSo for a code\u2011repo\u2013centric workflow, you\u2019re layering **generic tools + paid integrations** on top of a product that\u2019s not dev\u2011specific.\n\n---\n\n## 3. Cost\u2011effectiveness for daily code\u2011repo management\n\nPutting price patterns and features together:\n\n1. **Observed per\u2011user pricing (non\u2011Enterprise):**\n   - Jira is cheaper at the visible tiers:\n     - `7` vs `9.8`  \n     - `14` vs `24.8`\n   - If that relative spread carries into custom Enterprise quotes, **Jira Enterprise is likely cheaper per user than Wrike Enterprise** for similar deal sizes.\n\n2. **Feature fit for code repositories:**\n   - Jira is clearly oriented to software development:\n     - Agile boards, backlogs, reports are first\u2011class.\n     - Deep integration ecosystem (`appsAndIntegrations` via Marketplace) heavily targets Git/CI/CD tools.\n     - Unlimited storage and sites help large or multi\u2011repo organizations.\n   - Wrike is excellent as a generic work/PM tool but:\n     - Lacks explicit code\u2011repository or dev\u2011tool features in this YAML.\n     - You\u2019ll likely need **additional paid add\u2011ons** (`wrikeIntegrate`, possibly `wrikeTwoWaySync`) and custom configuration to reach the same level of repo\u2011centric integration you get more \u201cnatively\u201d with Jira.\n   - That means **more spend and more implementation effort** to get to an equivalent developer experience in Wrike.\n\n3. **Enterprise security/IT features:**\n   - Both Enterprise tiers bundle advanced security (SSO, IP policies, audit logs, etc.), so on that axis they are broadly comparable.\n   - Jira Enterprise also bundles `atlassianAccess` (which is an extra \u201cContact Sales\u201d add\u2011on on non\u2011Enterprise Jira), so if you need SSO/SCIM anyway, this improves Jira\u2019s value at the Enterprise tier.\n\n4. **Storage and scale:**\n   - Jira Enterprise: unlimited storage and sites.\n   - Wrike Enterprise: 100 GB storage limit (attachments) before additional costs or workarounds.\n   - For dev teams with many artifacts (attachments, screenshots, specs) around the code, Jira\u2019s unlimited storage can avoid extra fees.\n\n### So, is Jira Enterprise \u201cmore cost\u2011effective\u201d for this use case?\n\n- **Numerically, we cannot definitively prove it** from this data because *both* Enterprise plans say only \u201cContact Sales.\u201d\n- **Practically, for a team heavily focused on code repositories**, Jira Enterprise is **very likely** to be more cost\u2011effective because:\n  - Jira\u2019s feature set directly targets software development and integrates well with code repos out of the box.\n  - Wrike is more expensive at lower tiers and requires additional \u201cContact Sales\u201d add\u2011ons for advanced integrations, which increases total cost to get comparable repo\u2011centric workflows.\n\n---\n\n## 4. How to decide in practice\n\n1. **Get actual Enterprise quotes** from both vendors for the same seat count and contract term.  \n2. **Estimate add\u2011on needs:**\n   - Jira: likely no extra add\u2011on beyond what\u2019s bundled in Enterprise for most dev teams.\n   - Wrike: include prices for `wrikeIntegrate` / `wrikeTwoWaySync` if you need tight repo integration.\n3. **Pilot for 1\u20132 critical workflows**:\n   - \u201cIssue \u2194 commit \u2194 pull request\u201d linkage\n   - Release tracking and incident/bug workflows\n   - See which platform requires more custom work and add\u2011ons to achieve what you want.\n\nIf your primary requirement is **day\u2011to\u2011day management of code repositories and related work**, Jira (often even at the **Premium** level, not necessarily Enterprise) will almost always give you **better value per dollar** than Wrike used at the Enterprise tier. Wrike makes more sense if your main use case is broad cross\u2011functional work management and only secondarily touches code.",

Does the **Business** plan have a strict limit on \u201cEmail in ClickUp\u201d?\n\nThere are two different limits related to email:\n\n1. **Number of emails (\u201cEmail in ClickUp\u201d usage)**  \n   - Default (global): `useEmailInClickUp` = **100 uses**  \n   - **Business plan override**:  \n     ```yaml\n     useEmailInClickUp:\n       value: 1000000000\n     ```\n   - That\u2019s **1,000,000,000 email uses** per workspace, which is effectively unlimited for normal usage.  \n   - There is **no separate overage price per additional email sent** published in this pricing file.\n\n   So: the Business plan does *technically* have a numeric cap, but it is so high that it is effectively **not a practical limit on the number of emails you send from ClickUp**.\n\n2. **Number of connected email accounts**\n   - Global default:  \n     ```yaml\n     useEmailAccountsInClickUp:\n       defaultValue: 1  # 1 email account per workspace\n     ```\n   - **Business plan override**:  \n     ```yaml\n     useEmailAccountsInClickUp:\n       value: 2\n     ```\n   - On **Business**, you are limited to **2 email accounts per Workspace** by default.\n\n   This **is** a meaningful, strict limit unless you buy add\u2011ons.\n\n---\n\n### 2. Cost per unit if you need more than the included limit\n\nThe only published unit\u2011based overage in this context is **per additional email account**, not per email sent.\n\nAdd\u2011on in the YAML:\n\n```yaml\nextraEmailAccountInClickUp:\n  availableFor:\n  - UNLIMITED\n  - BUSINESS\n  - ENTERPRISE\n  price: 2\n  unit: account/month\n  usageLimitsExtensions:\n    useEmailAccountsInClickUp:\n      value: 1\n```\n\n- **Add\u2011on name**: `extraEmailAccountInClickUp`  \n- **Available for**: includes **BUSINESS**  \n- **Price**: **2.0 USD per account/month**  \n- **Effect**: each unit increases `useEmailAccountsInClickUp` by **1** (i.e., one more email account allowed per Workspace).\n\nSo, on the Business plan:\n\n- **Email send limit**: effectively unlimited (1,000,000,000 uses); no published per\u2011email overage fee.  \n- **Email accounts limit**: 2 accounts included.  \n- **Cost to exceed that limit**: **2.0 USD per additional email account per month** via the `extraEmailAccountInClickUp` add\u2011on.",

            "answer": "Here\u2019s what the archived CircleCI \u2013 Cloud pricing data for the **FREE** plan shows between the 2022 and 2025 versions.\n\n### 1. Subscription cost change\n\n- **2022 FREE plan price**: `0 $` per month (0 USD)  \n  - Source: `plans.FREE.price` in the 2022 pricing file (`version: '2022'`, createdAt `2022\u201111\u201106`).\n- **2025 FREE plan price**: `0 $` per month (0 USD)  \n  - Source: `plans.FREE.price` in the 2025 pricing file (`version: '2025'`, createdAt `2025\u201102\u201117`).\n\n**Conclusion:** The subscription cost for the **Free** plan did **not change** between 2022 and 2025; it remained **0 USD/month**.\n\n---\n\n### 2. Changes in what you get on the FREE plan\n\nAlthough the price stayed the same, there are a few measurable changes in included value.\n\n#### 2.1. Usage limits\n\nFrom the normalized subscription data:\n\n**2022 FREE**\n- `maxUsers`: **1**\n- `creditsLimit`: 30,000 credits/month\n- `networkLimit`: 1 GB\n- `storageLimit`: 2 GB\n- `concurrentJobRunsLimitNonMacOs`: 30\n- `concurrentJobRunsLimitMacOs`: 1\n- `selfHostedRunnersLimit`: 5\n- `flakyTestDetectionLimit`: 5\n\n**2025 FREE**\n- `maxUsers`: **5**\n- `creditsLimit`: 30,000 credits/month\n- `networkLimit`: 1 GB\n- `storageLimit`: 2 GB\n- `concurrentJobRunsLimitNonMacOs`: 30\n- `concurrentJobRunsLimitMacOs`: 1\n- `selfHostedRunnersLimit`: 5\n- `flakyTestDetectionLimit`: 5\n\n**Net change in limits for FREE:**\n- **Max users increased from 1 \u2192 5** users.\n- All other listed limits remained the same.\n\nSo, without any price change, the Free plan now officially supports up to **5 users instead of 1**.\n\n#### 2.2. Feature set differences\n\nThe Free plan in both years uses the plan defaults (`features: null`), so it includes all features whose `defaultValue` is `true` in each year\u2019s catalog.\n\nKey differences for the **FREE** plan between 2022 and 2025:\n\n1. **New management feature enabled by default in 2025**\n   - **2025 only** (and included in FREE):\n     - `releases` (type: MANAGEMENT, `defaultValue: true`)\n   - This did not exist in the 2022 feature list, so it\u2019s a **new capability** available even on the Free tier.\n\n2. **Compute/runner feature refinements**\n   - **2022 FREE compute features** (selected):\n     - `smallDockerVM`, `mediumDockerVM`, `mediumPlusDockerVM`, `largeDockerVM`\n     - `mediumLinuxVM`, `largeLinuxVM`\n     - `mediumArmVM`, `largeArmVM`, `xlargeArmVM`, `2xlargeArmVM`\n     - `mediumWindowsVM`, `largeWindowsVM`\n     - `mediumMacOsVM`\n   - **2025 FREE compute features** (selected):\n     - `smallX86DockerVM`, `mediumX86DockerVM`, `mediumX86PlusDockerVM`, `largeX86DockerVM`\n     - `mediumArmDockerVM`, `largeArmDockerVM` (new explicit ARM Docker executor types)\n     - `mediumLinuxVM`, `largeLinuxVM`\n     - `mediumArmVM`, `largeArmVM`, `xlargeArmVM`, `2xlargeArmVM`\n     - `mediumWindowsVM`, `largeWindowsVM`\n     - `m1MediumMacOsVM` (more specific Mac executor label)\n\n   This is mostly a **renaming and architecture clarification** (e.g., Docker \u2192 X86 Docker, `mediumMacOsVM` \u2192 `m1MediumMacOsVM`) plus explicit ARM Docker executors. Functionally, the Free tier continues to provide small\u2013large general-purpose Docker, Linux, Windows, ARM, and Mac executors; the value is at least comparable and arguably a bit more explicit and flexible.\n\n3. **Core CI/CD and support features (no major removals)**\n   - Present on FREE in **both** 2022 and 2025:\n     - `network`, `storage`\n     - `concurrentJobRuns`, `selfHostedRunners`, `dockerLayerCatching`\n     - `flakyTestDetection` (with limit 5)\n     - `privateOrbs`\n     - `communitySupport`\n   - More advanced items like `singleSignOn`, `configPolicies`, premium SLAs (`8x5SLA`, `24x7SLA`), and premium support channels remain **off** by default and are attached to paid plans or add\u2011ons, not to the Free plan.\n\n**Net feature change for FREE:**\n- **Added**: at least one clearly new Free-tier feature, `releases`.\n- **Improved**: user cap (1 \u2192 5 users), plus more explicit and expanded executor definitions (including ARM Docker), with no price increase.\n- No evidence of a feature removal that would offset these gains on the Free plan.\n\n---\n\n### 3. Direct answer to your question\n\n- **Subscription cost for the Free plan (CircleCI \u2013 Cloud):**\n  - **2022:** `0 $` per month (0 USD)\n  - **2025:** `0 $` per month (0 USD)\n  - **Change:** **No change** in subscription cost; it remains free.\n\n- **New or improved value that could \u201cjustify\u201d a higher price (even though there wasn\u2019t one):**\n  - The Free plan now:\n    - Supports **5 users instead of 1**.\n    - Includes a new management feature, **`releases`**, by default.\n    - Has more explicitly defined compute types (x86 vs ARM Docker, M1 Mac executors), while retaining access to small\u2013large executors.\n\nSo between the 2022 and 2025 price sheets, the Free plan\u2019s **price did not increase**, and its included value **improved modestly** (higher user cap and at least one new feature) rather than being cut back.",

Subscription cost change\n\nFrom the YAML data:\n\n| Snapshot | Date        | Plan    | Price | Currency | Billing unit |\n|---------|------------|---------|-------|----------|--------------|\n| 2023    | 2023\u201110\u201130 | STARTER | 29    | USD      | /month       |\n| 2024    | 2024\u201107\u201114 | STARTER | 29    | USD      | /month       |\n\n**Conclusion:**  \nThe **Starter plan price did not change** between 2023 and 2024 \u2013 it stayed at **29 USD/month**.\n\n---\n\n## 2. Feature and limit changes on Starter\n\nEven though the **price stayed the same**, the **structure and contents of the Starter plan changed quite a lot**.\n\n### 2.1. What Starter included in 2023 (2023\u201110\u201130)\n\nAt 29 USD/month, Starter mainly added:\n\n**Key \u201cextra\u201d features over the base level:**\n\n- `automations`: `true`  \n  - Enables automation features (type: `TASK_AUTOMATION`), e.g. automatic review syncing, goal tracking, review filtering.\n- `zapierIntegration`: `true`  \n  - Zapier integration for connecting Trustmary to other apps.\n\n**Usage limits on Starter (2023):**\n\n- `responsesLimit`: **25** responses/month (up from default 5).\n- `requestsViaEmailLimit`: **500** email requests/month (default 0).\n- `viewsLimit`: **5000** views/month (default 200).\n- `reviewPlatformConnectionsLimit`: **3** review platforms (up from default 1).\n\nPlus all defaults that applied to all plans then, such as:\n\n- Basic review management and widgets: `reviews`, `reviewWidgets`, `formWidgets`, `badgeWidgets`, `popupWidgets`, `ctaWidgets`, `views`.\n- Review management: `manageReviews`, `tagReviews`, `syncReviewsAutomatically`, `addReviewsManually`, `importReviewsFromSpreadsheets`.\n- SEO & scoring: `reviewSchema.orgMarkup`, `trustMaryAiScore`.\n- Support: `freeWidgetInstallationHelp`, `chatSupport`.\n\n**Summary for 2023:**  \nStarter was essentially **\u201cmore automations + Zapier + higher limits\u201d** on a review/widget\u2011centric product.\n\n---\n\n### 2.2. What Starter includes in 2024 (2024\u201107\u201114)\n\nIn 2024, at the same 29 USD/month, Starter is repositioned as a **survey and feedback suite with teams**, with many more explicitly listed capabilities.\n\n**Newly enabled / emphasized features on Starter (plan\u2011specific flags):**\n\n- Collaboration & structure\n  - `teams`: `true` (with `unlimitedTeamMembers: .inf`)\n  - `surveys`: `true` (with `unlimitedSuveys: .inf`)\n\n- Survey creation & UX\n  - `surveyTemplateLibrary`: `true`\n  - `surveyStatus`: `true` (track survey status)\n  - `progressBar`: `true` (show progress in surveys)\n  - `htmlEmbeds`: `true` (embed forms/surveys via HTML)\n  - `smsRequests`: `true` (SMS survey requests in Europe)\n  - `csatForms`: `true` (Customer Satisfaction forms)\n  - `customizableForms`: `true`\n  - `eighteenQuestionTypes`: `true` (broad question\u2011type support)\n  - `anonymizedResponses`: `true` (collect anonymous feedback)\n\n- Analysis & automation\n  - `analyzeFeedback`: `true` (feedback analysis tools)\n  - `syncReviewsAutomatically`: `true` (re\u2011enabled here for this plan; default is `false` in 2024)\n\n**Global features available to all plans in 2024 (so also to Starter):**\n\n- Core survey/feedback capabilities:\n  - `3in1Surveys`, `feedbackCollection`, `surveyLogic`, `customTheme`, `quickPreview`\n  - `npsForms`, `npsForms`, `emailNotificationsForNewResponses`\n  - Multiple channels: `urlResponses`, `emailResponses`, `popupSurvey`, `emailSignature`, `qrCode`\n- Review management:\n  - `manageReviews`, `tagReviews`, `autotagReviews`, `createReviewsManually`, `importReviewsFromSpreadsheets`, `publicReviewProfilePage`\n- Integrations:\n  - `zapierIntegration`: `true`\n  - `makeIntegration`: `true` (new integration platform in 2024)\n- Support:\n  - `freeSurveyHelp`, `chatSupport`  \n- Language/guarantees:\n  - `multilanguage`: `true`\n\n**Usage limits on Starter (2024):**\n\n- `unlimitedTeamMembers`: `.inf` (unlimited team members)\n- `unlimitedSuveys`: `.inf` (unlimited surveys)\n- `surveyResponsesLimit`: **20** survey responses/month (default 5).\n- `requestsViaEmailLimit`: **200** email requests/month (default 5).\n- `reviewPlatformConnectionsLimit`: **3** review platforms (same as 2023).\n\n**Notable trade\u2011offs vs 2023:**\n\n- **Lower response quota:**  \n  - 2023: 25 responses/month  \n  - 2024: 20 survey responses/month\n- **Lower email request quota:**  \n  - 2023: 500 email requests/month  \n  - 2024: 200 email requests/month\n- **View limits are no longer listed** (so the explicit `viewsLimit` of 5000/month is absent in 2024 \u2013 it may be unmetered or handled differently, but it\u2019s not specified in the 2024 YAML).\n\n---\n\n## 3. Did new features \u201cjustify\u201d a price change?\n\n- **Price:** Stayed at **29 USD/month** \u2014 **no increase** from 2023 to 2024.\n- **Value shift:**\n  - **Added**: A substantial bundle of **survey\u2011related features**, **collaboration (teams)**, **unlimited surveys**, **unlimited team members**, more channels (SMS, HTML embeds), more question types, anonymization, and **feedback analysis** tools.\n  - **Reduced**: Monthly **response** and **email request** quotas (25\u219220 responses; 500\u2192200 email requests), and some older widget/view\u2011style details are no longer explicitly listed.\n\nSo, rather than a price increase, the 2024 Starter plan keeps the **same monthly subscription cost (29 USD/month)** while **re\u2011balancing the offering**: far more capabilities around surveys, teams, and analysis, but with **stricter usage limits** on responses and email requests.",

Subscription cost change (2021 \u2192 2022)\n\nFrom the two archived snapshots:\n\n- **2021-09-20**  \n  - Plan: `FREE`  \n  - **Price:** `0`  \n  - **Unit:** `user/month`  \n  - **Currency:** `USD`\n\n- **2022-11-28**  \n  - Plan: `FREE`  \n  - **Price:** `0`  \n  - **Unit:** `user/month`  \n  - **Currency:** `USD`\n\n**Conclusion:**  \nBetween 2021 and 2022, the subscription cost for the **Free** plan **did not change**. It remained **0 USD per user/month**.\n\n---\n\n### 2. Were any new features added to the Free plan?\n\nWhile the price stayed at 0 USD, the underlying feature set described in the pricing page expanded between 2021 and 2022. Because the Free plan does not override any features (`features: null`), it inherits the global default features in each year.\n\nComparing the two snapshots:\n\n#### New (or newly advertised) features available to Free by 2022\n\nThese features appear in the 2022 pricing data but not in the 2021 data, with defaults that make them available on all plans, including Free:\n\n- **voiceMessages** (2022, `defaultValue: true`)  \n  - \u201cTap, talk, and send to give updates, share ideas, and be more expressive.\u201d\n\n- **oneOnOneVoiceAndVideoCalls** (2022, `defaultValue: true`)  \n  - \u201cGo from typing to talking in a single click, with 1:1 voice and video calls.\u201d\n\nSince their `defaultValue` is `true` and the Free plan doesn\u2019t override them, these features are effectively part of the **Free** plan in 2022.\n\n#### Features that changed but remain paid-only\n\nSeveral more advanced features either appeared for the first time or changed type in 2022, but are **not** enabled for Free (their `defaultValue` is `false` and only the PRO plan sets them to `true`), for example:\n\n- **screenSharing**\n- **customizableSections** (similar role to the old `customizableSidebars`)\n- **guestAccess**\n- **manageUserAccounts**\n- **permissions**\n- **userGroups**\n- **priorityCustomerSupport**\n\nSo for the Free plan, these are still unavailable in 2022, just as their equivalents or precursors were effectively unavailable in 2021.\n\n---\n\n### 3. Overall assessment\n\n- **Price:**  \n  - No increase: the Free plan remained at **0 USD per user/month** from 2021 to 2022.\n\n- **Feature evolution:**  \n  - The Free plan **gained functionality** (notably **voice messages** and **1:1 voice & video calls**) at the same zero price.\n  - Core collaboration features (channels, direct messages, reactions, unlimited message history, file sharing with 10 GB/account, encryption, standard support) remained available in both years.\n\nSo there was **no price change to justify**, and in fact, relative to 2021, the Free plan in 2022 offers **more communication features for the same 0 USD cost**.",

            "answer": "Here\u2019s what changed for Trello\u2019s **Enterprise** plan between late 2019 and late 2020, based on the archived pricing data you provided.\n\n---\n\n## 1. Subscription cost change\n\n- **2019 Enterprise price**:  \n  - `20.83 USD` per user/month (plan `ENTERPRISE`, unit: `user/month`)\n- **2020 Enterprise price**:  \n  - `17.50 USD` per user/month\n\n**Net change**:  \n- Decrease of **3.33 USD per user/month**, i.e. roughly a **16% price reduction** for the Enterprise plan itself.\n\n(The annual billing discount factor `0.7792` is the same in both years, so the relative decrease is essentially the same on an annualized basis.)\n\n---\n\n## 2. Feature changes in the Enterprise plan itself\n\nComparing the **Enterprise** feature sets:\n\n### New in 2020 Enterprise (vs 2019)\n\n- **`advancedChecklists`**  \n  - 2020 introduces this as a Standard Feature and sets it to **true** on Enterprise.  \n  - It was not present at all in the 2019 spec for Trello.\n\nSo the clearest *added* Enterprise capability in 2020 is support for **advanced checklists**.\n\n### Removed / no longer mentioned in 2020 Enterprise\n\n- **`personalizedOnboarding`**  \n  - Present and enabled (`true`) in **2019 Enterprise**.\n  - Not listed at all in the 2020 feature set, and not turned on in the 2020 Enterprise plan.\n\nSo, relative to 2019, 2020 Enterprise **adds** advanced checklists but **drops** personalized onboarding.\n\n### Otherwise largely unchanged\n\nBoth 2019 and 2020 Enterprise include, with the feature set set to `true`:\n\n- Admin & security features like:\n  - `2factorAuthentication`\n  - `advancedAdminPermissions`\n  - `domainRestrictedInvites`\n  - `deactivateMembers`\n  - `googleAppsSignOn`\n  - `simpleDataExport`\n  - `powerUpAdministration`\n  - `attachmentRestrictions`\n  - `organizationWidePermissions`\n  - `organizationVisibleBoards`\n  - `publicBoardManagement`\n- Productivity & Power-Ups:\n  - `customFields`, `listLimits`, `cardRepeater`, `calendarView`, `mapView`, `voting`,\n    `appIntegrations`\n- Automation:\n  - `butlerScheduledCommands`, `butlerCommandAdministration`,\n    `butlerEmailNotifications`, `butlerHttpRequests`\n- Plus visual & collaboration extras:\n  - `prioritySupport`, `observers`, `customBackgrounds`, `customStickers`,\n    `teamBoards`, `boardCollections`, `teamBoardTemplates`\n\n**Usage limits for Enterprise** (attachments, power-ups per board, Butler command quotas, etc.) remain effectively **unlimited (`.inf`)** in both years, so there is no added limitation to explain the lower price.\n\n---\n\n## 3. Single Sign-On and the new Atlassian Access add\u2011on\n\nA key structural change between 2019 and 2020 is how **Single Sign-On (SSO)** and some security controls are described and packaged:\n\n### 2019\n\n- `singleSignOn` description (2019):  \n  > \u201cProvides easy and secure access to Trello for employees by integrating directly with top identity providers including Microsoft Azure, OneLogin, Okta, and G Suit\u201d\n\n- In **2019 Enterprise**, `singleSignOn: true` is part of the plan itself, with **no separate add\u2011on** mentioned.\n\n### 2020\n\nIn 2020, SSO is tied to **Atlassian Access**:\n\n- `singleSignOn` description (2020):  \n  > \u201cIncrease security and simplify login with Atlassian Access, a separate subscription that your company can enable across all your Atlassian cloud products, starting at $3/month/user.\u201d\n\n- New **add\u2011on** in 2020:\n\n  ```yaml\n  addOns:\n    ATLASSIAN_ACCESS:\n      description: Atlassian Access is a separate subscription ... starts at $3/month/user.\n      price: 3\n      unit: user/month\n      features:\n        enforce2FA: true\n        singleSignOn: true\n  ```\n\n  - **New feature here**: `enforce2FA` (ability to *enforce* 2\u2011factor auth across users).\n  - `singleSignOn` is also enabled via this add-on.\n\n- The 2020 **Enterprise** plan itself still lists `singleSignOn: true`, but the description clearly states that SSO is delivered through **Atlassian Access**, which is **priced separately at 3 USD/user/month** (starting price) across all Atlassian cloud products.\n\n**Implication for \u201ceffective\u201d SSO-inclusive pricing:**\n\n- 2019: Enterprise with SSO \u2248 **20.83 USD/user/month** (SSO bundled).\n- 2020: Enterprise base **17.50** + Atlassian Access **3.00** \u2248 **20.50 USD/user/month**.\n\nSo if you include SSO via Atlassian Access, the **total effective price for an SSO-enabled Enterprise deployment changed very little** (slightly lower in 2020 by about 0.33 USD/user/month), but part of the functionality was shifted into a separate, cross\u2011product subscription.\n\n---\n\n## 4. Answering your question directly\n\n- **How did the Enterprise subscription cost change from 2019 to 2020?**  \n  - The nominal Enterprise plan price **decreased** from **20.83 USD** to **17.50 USD per user/month**, a reduction of **3.33 USD (~16%)**.  \n  - For organizations that also need SSO, Trello in 2020 expects you to use **Atlassian Access** at **3 USD/user/month**, making the combined \u201cEnterprise + SSO\u201d cost roughly **20.50 USD/user/month**, almost the same as 2019.\n\n- **Were any new features added to justify the change?**\n  - Within the Enterprise plan itself:\n    - **Added:** `advancedChecklists`\n    - **Removed:** `personalizedOnboarding`\n    - Core admin, security, automation, and Power-Up capabilities and unlimited usage limits stayed essentially the same.\n  - At the ecosystem level:\n    - **New optional add-on:** **Atlassian Access** (3 USD/user/month) adds **enforceable 2FA (`enforce2FA`)** and moves SSO into a centralized, cross\u2011Atlassian subscription.\n\nSo, strictly on the **Enterprise plan alone**, you see a **price decrease with a modest feature change** (gain of advanced checklists, loss of personalized onboarding).  \nIf you factor in **SSO via Atlassian Access**, the **overall \u201cEnterprise + SSO\u201d cost is nearly flat year\u2011over\u2011year**, with the main new justifying features being centralized security controls (like enforced 2FA) provided through Atlassian Access rather than Trello Enterprise itself.",

Feature changes for the Free plan**\n\nEven though the Free plan stayed at **0 USD**, there were some **feature-level changes** between 2023 and 2024.\n\n### Features that stayed enabled on Free\nThese were explicitly enabled in both 2023 and 2024:\n\n- **Grid view** of content  \n- **List view** of content  \n- **Sync previous content** (import content published outside of Planable)  \n- **Required approval workflows**  \n- **Multi\u2011level approval workflows**\n\nSo the core \u201cadvanced workflow\u201d and extra views stayed as Free\u2011plan perks.\n\n### Notable additions / evolutions affecting Free\n\nBetween the 2023\u201110\u201121 and 2024\u201107\u201118 configurations, Planable introduced or renamed several platform features that, by default, apply to all plans (including Free):\n\n- **AI content tools** (replacing the older generic \u201cAI assistant\u201d):\n  - `aiPostRewrite` \u2013 AI\u2011powered rewriting of posts  \n  - `aiPostGenerate` \u2013 AI\u2011powered generation of posts from prompts\n\n- **Scheduling and automation improvements:**\n  - `firstCommentScheduling` \u2013 schedule the first comment along with the main post  \n  - `recurringPosts` \u2013 set posts to recur automatically\n\n- **Planning & creation enhancements:**\n  - `omnichannelPlanning` \u2013 plan content across multiple channels in one workflow  \n  - `builtInMediaEditor` \u2013 edit media directly inside Planable  \n  - `sharedContentPlanning` \u2013 improved collaborative planning of content  \n  - `textAnnotations` \u2013 annotate text in posts  \n  - `suggestEdits` \u2013 suggest and review edits collaboratively\n\nThe pricing configuration lists these with `defaultValue: true`, and there are no Free\u2011plan overrides turning them off, so they are **available on the Free plan as of 2024**.\n\n### Collaboration rename/split\n\nIn 2023, the Free plan explicitly enabled:\n\n- `internalAndExternalCollaboration`: described as \u201chave the option to hold conversations and posts behind the scenes, out of approver\u2019s sight.\u201d\n\nIn 2024, that capability appears as:\n\n- `teamOnlyDraftPosts` (explicitly enabled on Free), with essentially the same description.\n- A related feature `teamOnlyNotes` exists but is only turned on for higher tiers (PRO, ENTERPRISE).\n\nSo, for Free users, **the hidden/\u201cteam\u2011only\u201d collaboration on draft posts remains**, just under a new name and slightly restructured model.\n\n### Feature that disappeared from the spec\n\nIn 2023, the Free plan also had:\n\n- `saveAsAnAd`: \u201csend your Facebook drafts as a dark post to your Ads Manager.\u201d\n\nBy 2024, `saveAsAnAd` is no longer listed at all (for any plan) in the pricing configuration. That looks like a **product\u2011wide removal or de\u2011emphasis**, not something tied specifically to a price change on the Free plan.\n\n---\n\n**3. Direct answer to your question**\n\n- **Cost change:** The Free plan cost **did not change** between 2023 and 2024; it is `0 USD / month` in both snapshots.\n- **New features to justify the change:** There was **no price increase to justify**, but the Free plan **did gain new or evolved capabilities**, particularly:\n  - More granular AI tools (`aiPostRewrite`, `aiPostGenerate`)  \n  - New scheduling/automation (e.g., `firstCommentScheduling`, `recurringPosts`)  \n  - Creation and collaboration enhancements (omnichannel planning, built\u2011in media editor, shared content planning, text annotations, suggest\u2011edits, and the renamed `teamOnlyDraftPosts` feature).\n\nSo, overall, from the data we have, **the Free plan\u2019s price stayed the same while the feature set became richer**, not the other way around.",

            "answer": "Based on the pricing data available for Planable (snapshot dated **2022\u201110\u201130**), there is **no separate Enterprise + feed view add\u2011on vs \u201call\u2011inclusive\u201d Enterprise** distinction:\n\n1. **Feed view is already included by default**\n   - In the `features` section, `feedView` has:\n     - `defaultValue: true`\n   - None of the plans (including `ENTERPRISE`) override this to `false`, so **feed view is included in all plans by default**, including Enterprise.\n\n2. **There is no \u201cfeed view\u201d add\u2011on in the add-ons list**\n   - The only add-on defined for Planable is:\n     - `extraWorkspace` at **20 USD / workspace/month**, available only for **BASIC** and **PRO**.\n   - There is **no add-on for `feedView`** or any other view type (`calendarView`, `gridView`, `listView`) in the add-on section for **any** plan, including Enterprise.\n\n3. **Enterprise plan is already \u201call-inclusive\u201d for views**\n   - The `ENTERPRISE` plan explicitly includes:\n     - `gridView: true`\n     - `listView: true`\n   - And, by defaults:\n     - `feedView: true`\n     - `calendarView: true`\n   - So, from this pricing spec, the **standard Enterprise plan already gives you all views (feed, calendar, grid, list)**. There is no cheaper \u201cEnterprise without feed view\u201d variant and thus nothing to upgrade with a feed-view add-on.\n\n4. **Enterprise price is custom**\n   - The `ENTERPRISE` plan has:\n     - `price: Custom`\n     - `unit: user/month`\n   - Because the Enterprise price is custom and there\u2019s **no defined feed view add-on**, we cannot compute any alternative \u201cEnterprise + feed add-on\u201d combination. The only Enterprise offering in this data is the one that already includes feed view.\n\n---\n\n### Direct answer to your question\n\nWith the pricing information provided:\n\n- **You cannot save money by buying an Enterprise plan and adding feed view as an add-on**\u2014that combination does not exist in this pricing model.\n- The **Enterprise plan already includes feed view**, along with all other views, so it is inherently the \u201call-inclusive\u201d option for views.\n\nIf you\u2019re seeing a different structure on Planable\u2019s current site (e.g., \u201cEnterprise (feed-only) vs Enterprise All-Inclusive\u201d), that is newer than this 2022 snapshot. In that case, the only way to know which is cheaper is:\n\n1. Get the per\u2011user price for:\n   - Base Enterprise (without all views), and\n   - The feed view (or additional views) add-on(s), and\n   - The all-inclusive Enterprise option.\n2. Compare:\n   - `Base Enterprise + required add-ons` vs `All-Inclusive Enterprise`\n   on a **per\u2011user, per\u2011month basis**, multiplied by your **number of users**.\n\nBut strictly from the provided Planable pricing data: **there is only one Enterprise plan, already including feed view, and no feed-view add-on**, so there is no cheaper alternative configuration to compare.",

            "answer": "From the pricing data you provided, it\u2019s **not possible to compute a precise \u201ccheaper vs more expensive\u201d answer in dollars**, because both:\n\n- **Jira Enterprise** and  \n- **Atlassian Access (the add\u2011on)**  \n\nare priced as **`Contact Sales`** rather than numeric amounts.\n\nHere\u2019s what we *can* say, based on the YAML and the tool results, and how to think about the trade\u2011off.\n\n---\n\n## 1. What the pricing file actually says\n\nFrom the `pricing2yaml`:\n\n### Base Jira plans (per user/month)\n\n- **FREE**\n  - `price: 0`\n  - `usersLimit: 10`\n  - `sitesLimit: 1`\n  - `storageLimit: 2 GB`\n- **STANDARD**\n  - `price: 7`\n  - `usersLimit: 20000`\n  - `storageLimit: 250 GB`\n- **PREMIUM**\n  - `price: 14`\n  - `usersLimit: 20000`\n  - `storageLimit: Infinity`\n- **ENTERPRISE**\n  - `price: Contact Sales`\n  - `usersLimit: 20000`\n  - `sitesLimit: Infinity`\n  - `storageLimit: Infinity`\n\n### Atlassian Access add\u2011on\n\n- **Add\u2011on name:** `atlassianAccessAddOn`\n- **Available for:** `FREE`, `STANDARD`, `PREMIUM`\n- **Price:** `Contact Sales` (non\u2011numeric)\n- **Effect:** sets feature `atlassianAccess: true` (i.e., turns on the Atlassian Access capability)\n\n### Where Atlassian Access comes from\n\nAll subscriptions that include the `atlassianAccess` feature in the tool output:\n\n1. **FREE + atlassianAccessAddOn**\n2. **STANDARD + atlassianAccessAddOn**\n3. **PREMIUM + atlassianAccessAddOn**\n4. **ENTERPRISE** (includes `atlassianAccess` in the plan itself; no add\u2011on)\n\nThe optimization tool tried to find the cheapest subscription that includes `atlassianAccess`, but:\n\n- For **FREE / STANDARD / PREMIUM + Atlassian Access**, it reported:  \n  > \u201cSubscription cost includes add-ons with non-numeric prices, cannot calculate total cost. Please check the pricing data or contact sales.\u201d\n- For **ENTERPRISE**, it reported:  \n  > \u201cSubscription cost includes non-numeric plan price, cannot calculate total cost. Please check the pricing data or contact sales.\u201d\n\nSo **the optimizer cannot actually compare total costs**, because critical prices are \u201cContact Sales\u201d.\n\n---\n\n## 2. Structural cost comparison: what we *can* infer\n\nEven without exact dollars, we can see the cost structure:\n\n### Option A: Jira FREE + Atlassian Access add\u2011on\n\n- **Jira license cost:**  \n  - `0 USD/user/month` for Jira itself.\n- **Atlassian Access cost:**  \n  - `Contact Sales` (the *entire* paid portion for this combo).\n- **Usage limits:**\n  - Up to **10 users**\n  - **1 site**\n  - **2 GB** storage\n- **Key effect:** you get Jira\u2019s Free feature set, plus `atlassianAccess` (centralized identity/security controls).\n\nSo for up to 10 users, your **Jira component is free**; you only pay whatever Atlassian Access costs.\n\n### Option B: Jira ENTERPRISE (includes Access)\n\n- **Jira Enterprise price:**  \n  - `Contact Sales` per user/month (no numeric value)\n- **Atlassian Access:**  \n  - **Included**: `atlassianAccess: true` is part of the Enterprise plan.\n- **Expanded limits and features vs Free+Access:**\n  - Up to **20,000 users**\n  - **Unlimited sites** (`sitesLimit: Infinity`)\n  - **Unlimited storage** (`storageLimit: Infinity`)\n  - All of these Enterprise\u2011level extras (beyond what Free+Access gives):\n    - `advancedRoadmaps`\n    - `globalAndMultiProjectAutomation`\n    - `advancedPermissions`\n    - `projectArchiving`\n    - `auditLogs`\n    - `anonymousAccess`\n    - `adminInsights`\n    - `ipAllowlisting`\n    - `sandbox`\n    - `releaseTracks`\n    - `dataResidency`\n    - `enterpriseSupport`\n    - `orgLevelBilling`\n    - `uptimeSLA`\n    - 24\u00d77 and higher\u2011tier support\n\nSo with Enterprise, you\u2019re effectively paying a single **(unknown) \u201cContact Sales\u201d price** that bundles:\n\n- Jira license, **plus**\n- Atlassian Access, **plus**\n- All Enterprise\u2011only features above.\n\n---\n\n## 3. So, which is cheaper?\n\nBased *strictly* on this pricing file and tool outputs:\n\n- We **cannot compute exact totals**, because:\n  - Atlassian Access add\u2011on price: `Contact Sales`\n  - Jira Enterprise price: `Contact Sales`\n- The tooling explicitly says:\n  > cannot calculate total cost \u2026 contact sales\n\nHowever, you can interpret the structure this way:\n\n### If you have \u2264 10 users\n\n- **Jira Free + Atlassian Access**\n  - Jira cost: **0 USD/user/month**\n  - You pay **only** the Atlassian Access price.\n  - Hard caps: 10 users, 1 site, 2 GB storage.\n  - You *do not* get Enterprise\u2011only features like unlimited sites, unlimited storage, data residency, sandbox, org\u2011level billing, enterprise support, etc.\n- **Jira Enterprise**\n  - You pay a **Contact Sales** Enterprise rate that includes:\n    - Jira itself\n    - Atlassian Access capabilities\n    - The full Enterprise feature set\n  - No Free\u2011tier usage limits.\n\nFor a small team that can live within **10 users / 2 GB / 1 site** and primarily needs **SSO and security controls**, the **cost drivers** are:\n\n- Free+Access: **you are only paying for Atlassian Access**, not Jira licenses.\n- Enterprise: you are paying for Jira + Access + all enterprise extras.\n\nSo structurally, **Free + Atlassian Access is the \u201cleanest\u201d way to get Access**, because Jira itself is free. Enterprise necessarily bundles far more than you need for a 10\u2011user team.\n\nThat said, because both **Enterprise and the Access add\u2011on use non\u2011numeric \u201cContact Sales\u201d pricing**, this file **cannot prove in dollars** that Free+Access is cheaper; it can only show that:\n\n- Free+Access minimizes the *Jira* license component (0 USD),\n- while Enterprise adds many more features and scalability on top of Access.\n\n### If you have > 10 users\n\nThen **Jira Free is not an option** at all (Free has `usersLimit: 10`), so the real comparison for you is:\n\n- **STANDARD or PREMIUM + Atlassian Access add\u2011on**  \n  vs  \n- **ENTERPRISE (with Access included)**\n\nThat\u2019s a different question than the one you asked, but the same limitation applies: the file still uses `Contact Sales` for:\n\n- Atlassian Access add\u2011on, and\n- Enterprise plan,\n\nso you\u2019ll need a sales quote to know which is cheaper at your user count.\n\n---\n\n## 4. Practical takeaway\n\nFrom this pricing data:\n\n- **We cannot compute exact \u201ccheaper\u201d vs \u201cmore expensive\u201d** between:\n  - Jira Free + Atlassian Access, and\n  - Jira Enterprise,\n  because both rely on non\u2011numeric `Contact Sales` prices.\n- **We can say structurally:**\n  - Jira **Free + Atlassian Access** is the lowest\u2011cost way to get Access if:\n    - You have **10 or fewer users**, and\n    - You don\u2019t need Enterprise\u2011exclusive capabilities (unlimited sites/storage, data residency, enterprise support, advanced admin controls, etc.).\n  - **Enterprise** becomes relevant when:\n    - You need to scale well beyond Free\u2019s limits, and/or\n    - You specifically need those advanced Enterprise features and support levels.\n\n---\n\n### What you should do next\n\n1. **Check your actual needs:**\n   - Number of Jira users.\n   - Need for data residency, unlimited sites, sandbox, enterprise support, org\u2011level billing, etc.\n2. **Ask Atlassian (or a reseller) for two concrete quotes at your user count:**\n   - Jira Free/Standard/Premium **+ Atlassian Access**.\n   - Jira **Enterprise** (which already includes Access).\n\nOnly with those quoted \u201cContact Sales\u201d prices can you definitively say which option is cheaper for your situation.",

Performance + Silver Premium Support\n\nFrom the YAML:\n\n- **PERFORMANCE plan**\n  - `price: 15`\n  - `unit: /month`\n  - Currency: **USD**\n  - Included:\n    - Up to **3 users** (`maxUsers: 3`)\n    - **25,000** non\u2011renewable credits/week\n    - Concurrency: **80** non\u2011macOS jobs, **15** macOS jobs\n    - Advanced executors (large/xlarge Linux & Windows, medium macOS)\n    - `dockerLayerCatching: true`\n    - `ticketBasedGlobalSupport: true` (but no explicit SLA/AM/CSM by default)\n\n- **silverPremiumSupport add\u2011on**\n  - `price: 249`\n  - `unit: /month`\n  - Available for: **PERFORMANCE** only\n  - Adds:\n    - `supportPortal: true`\n    - `ticketBasedGlobalSupport: true`\n    - `8x5SLA: true`\n    - `dedicatedAccountManager: true`\n    - `dedicatedSuccessManager: true`\n    - `checklistProjectPlanning: true`\n    - `documentedResourcesTraining: true`\n    - `emailSupport: true`\n    - SLA targets:\n      - `urgentSeverityLevel: \"2 business hours\"`\n      - `highSeverityLevel: \"4 business hours\"`\n      - `normalSeverityLevel: \"1 business day\"`\n      - `lowSeverityLevel: \"Prompt response\"`\n\n**Total price for Performance + Silver:**\n\n- **15 USD/month (Performance) + 249 USD/month (Silver) = 264 USD/month**\n\nThe solver output confirms this combined configuration with a **cost of `\"264 $\"`**.\n\n---\n\n## 2. Scale plan\n\nFrom the YAML:\n\n- **SCALE plan**\n  - `price: \"Contact us\"`\n  - `unit: /month`\n  - Currency: USD, but **no numeric price**.\n  - Included resources (superset of Performance):\n    - All Performance executors, plus **2xLarge** sizes\n    - **GPU machines**: `smallGpuNvidia`, `mediumGpuNvidia`, `mediumWindowsGpuNvidia`\n    - `selfHostedRunners: true`\n    - `flexibleBillingOptions: true`\n    - **Unlimited**:\n      - `maxUsers: .inf`\n      - `nonRenewableCredits: .inf`\n      - `concurrentJobRunsLimitNonMacOs: .inf`\n      - `concurrentJobRunsLimitMacOs: .inf`\n  - Included support (stronger than Silver):\n    - `communitySupport: true`\n    - `supportPortal: true`\n    - `ticketBasedGlobalSupport: true`\n    - `24x5SLA: true`\n    - `dedicatedAccountManager: true`\n    - `dedicatedSuccessManager: true`\n    - `dedicatedSuccessEngineer: true`\n    - `checklistProjectPlanning: true`\n    - `standardProjectPlanning: true`\n    - `documentedResourcesTraining: true`\n    - `cseLedTraining: true`\n    - `regularRecurringMeetingsWithYourSuccessTeam: true`\n    - `valueAddedServices: true` (with `amountOfValueAddedServices: 3`)\n    - `emailSupport: true`\n    - SLA targets:\n      - `urgentSeverityLevel: \"1 hour 24x5\"`\n      - `highSeverityLevel: \"2 hours 24x5\"`\n      - `normalSeverityLevel: \"8 hours 24x5\"`\n      - `lowSeverityLevel: \"Prompt response\"`\n\nTool output for SCALE:\n\n- `\"cost\": \"Subscription cost includes non-numeric plan price, cannot calculate total cost. Please check the pricing data or contact sales.\"`\n\nSo for **SCALE**, the price is **not numeric** and must be obtained from sales.\n\n---\n\n## 3. Direct comparison: which is cheaper?\n\nNumerically, we can state only:\n\n- **Performance + Silver Premium Support:**  \n  **264 USD/month**\n\n- **Scale plan:**  \n  **Price not specified \u2013 \"Contact us\"**, solver cannot compute a total cost.\n\nBecause the SCALE plan\u2019s price is not provided in the pricing file and is explicitly \u201cContact us,\u201d **there is no way, from this data, to definitively say whether SCALE is cheaper or more expensive than 264 USD/month.** Any claim beyond that would be a guess.\n\n---\n\n## 4. How to think about \u201cbetter deal\u201d\n\nFrom this dataset:\n\n- **Performance + Silver (264 USD/month)** is:\n  - Capped at **3 users** and 25k non\u2011renewable credits/week.\n  - Gives you **silver\u2011level support**:\n    - 8\u00d75 SLA\n    - Dedicated account & success managers\n    - Project planning + training resources\n    - Business\u2011hours response times.\n\n- **Scale (price unknown)**:\n  - **Unlimited** users and credits; effectively unlimited concurrency.\n  - More powerful machine types (2xLarge, GPUs) and **self\u2011hosted runners**.\n  - **Stronger support than Silver**:\n    - 24\u00d75 SLA instead of 8\u00d75.\n    - Faster response times (1h for urgent, 24\u00d75).\n    - Dedicated **success engineer**, more planning/training, value\u2011added services.\n\nSo:\n\n- If your main need is \u201cPerformance\u2011level compute + Silver\u2011level support\u201d for a small team (\u22643 users) and you don\u2019t need GPUs, self\u2011hosted runners, or unlimited concurrency, then **Performance + Silver at 264 USD/month** is the only option in this file with a clear, published price.\n- If you need **unlimited scale, GPUs, self\u2011hosted runners, or enterprise\u2011grade 24\u00d75 support with a dedicated success engineer**, you\u2019re in **Scale** territory\u2014but you must **contact CircleCI for pricing** to see whether it\u2019s cost\u2011effective for your usage.\n\n---\n\n### Bottom line\n\n- **We can\u2019t conclusively say which is cheaper** because the **Scale** plan price is not provided and is treated as non\u2011numeric in the tooling.\n- What we can say precisely is:\n  - **Performance + Silver Premium Support = 264 USD/month**.\n  - **Scale = \u201cContact us\u201d (price varies; check with CircleCI sales).**\n\nFor an actual decision, you\u2019d need a Scale quote based on your expected number of users, build volume, and required support level, then compare that against **264 USD/month** (plus any extra user/credit add\u2011ons you might need on Performance).",

            "answer": "From the pricing data we have, there is no way to state **numerically** whether:\n\n- **Jira FREE + Atlassian Guard add\u2011on**, or  \n- **Jira ENTERPRISE (which includes Atlassian Guard)**  \n\nis cheaper, because **both options involve non\u2011numeric \u201cContact Sales\u201d prices.**\n\n---\n\n## What the pricing actually says\n\nFrom the Jira pricing YAML:\n\n- **FREE plan**\n  - `price: 0` (unit: user/month)\n  - Max **10 users** per site\n  - **1 site**, **2 GB storage**, **100 automation rules/month**, **100 emails/day**\n  - Support: **communitySupport** only\n  - Does **not** include Atlassian Guard by default.\n\n- **Atlassian Guard add\u2011on (`atlassianGuardAddOn`)**\n  - `availableFor: [FREE, STANDARD, PREMIUM]`\n  - `price: Contact Sales` (unit: user/month)\n  - Adds feature: `atlassianGuard: true`\n\n- **ENTERPRISE plan**\n  - `price: Contact Sales` (unit: user/month)\n  - Includes `atlassianGuard: true` **by default** (no add\u2011on listed)\n  - Very high / unlimited limits:\n    - `usersLimit: 50000`\n    - `sitesLimit: 150`\n    - Unlimited automation, storage, email notifications\n  - Extra enterprise\u2011only features:\n    - Advanced planning & hierarchy\n    - `atlassianAnalytics`, `atlassianDataLake`, `dataConnectors`\n    - `ipAllowlisting`, `multipleIdp`, `auditLogsForUsersActivity`, `byokEncryption`\n    - `enterpriseSupport`, `24x7Support`, `uptimeSLA`, etc.\n\nSo, numerically we know:\n\n- FREE = **0 USD/user/month**\n- STANDARD = **7.16 USD/user/month**\n- PREMIUM = **12.48 USD/user/month**\n- Atlassian Guard add\u2011on = **Contact Sales**\n- ENTERPRISE = **Contact Sales**\n\n---\n\n## What the optimizer did (and its limitation)\n\nI ran an optimization asking: *\u201cWhat is the cheapest plan that includes the `atlassianGuard` feature?\u201d*\n\nThe tool returned:\n\n- **Plan**: `\"FREE\"`  \n- **Add\u2011ons**: `[\"atlassianGuardAddOn\"]`  \n- **Cost**:  \n  > \"Subscription cost includes add-ons with non-numeric prices, cannot calculate total cost. Please check the pricing data or contact sales.\"\n\n**Why it structurally chose FREE + Guard:**\n\n- FREE base price: **0**\n- STANDARD base price: **7.16**\n- PREMIUM base price: **12.48**\n- All three (FREE, STANDARD, PREMIUM) use the *same* add\u2011on: `atlassianGuardAddOn` with `price: Contact Sales`.\n\nIf the Guard add\u2011on price per user is identical across these tiers, then:\n\n- **FREE + Guard** has lower *base* cost than **STANDARD + Guard** or **PREMIUM + Guard**.\n\nHowever:\n\n- The add\u2011on itself is non\u2011numeric (\u201cContact Sales\u201d), so the *total* cost is unknown.\n- ENTERPRISE\u2019s price is also \u201cContact Sales\u201d, so the optimizer **cannot compare** FREE+Guard vs ENTERPRISE in dollars.\n\n---\n\n## So, is FREE + Guard cheaper than ENTERPRISE?\n\nFrom the data:\n\n- **We cannot compute or prove which is cheaper**, because:\n  - **FREE + Atlassian Guard add\u2011on** \u2192 add\u2011on price is \u201cContact Sales\u201d.\n  - **ENTERPRISE** \u2192 plan price is also \u201cContact Sales\u201d.\n\nYou\u2019ll only know by getting actual quotes for your user count.\n\nWhat we *can* say based on structure and limits:\n\n1. **If you can live within FREE\u2019s limits**  \n   - \u2264 **10 users**\n   - **1 site**\n   - **2 GB** storage\n   - Low automation and email limits\n   - Community support only  \n   \n   Then **FREE + Atlassian Guard add\u2011on** is the *minimal* paid configuration that gives you Atlassian Guard, and its base Jira cost is 0. In practice, for a very small team, this is almost always going to be cheaper than an Enterprise agreement that includes many more features and very high limits.\n\n2. **If you exceed FREE\u2019s limits or need enterprise\u2011only features**  \n   - More than 10 users or more than 1 site\n   - Need unlimited storage/automation, multiple IdPs, IP allowlisting, data lake/analytics, BYOK encryption, enterprise\u2011grade support & SLAs, etc.  \n\n   Then **FREE is not a viable choice** at all, regardless of Guard pricing. At that point you\u2019d compare:\n   - STANDARD + Guard\n   - PREMIUM + Guard\n   - ENTERPRISE (includes Guard)\n\n   \u2014 and you\u2019d need quotes to see if Enterprise\u2019s bundle comes out cheaper per user than \u201cmid\u2011tier + Guard\u201d.\n\n---\n\n## How to get a real answer for your case\n\nTo truly know which is cheaper for you:\n\n1. Decide your expected:\n   - **Number of users**\n   - **Number of sites**\n   - Any must\u2011have features beyond Guard (e.g., analytics, data residency, multi\u2011IdP, enterprise support).\n\n2. Ask Atlassian (or a reseller) for **two quotes for that same user count**:\n   - **Option A**: Jira FREE (or STANDARD/PREMIUM if you exceed FREE limits) + Atlassian Guard add\u2011on  \n   - **Option B**: Jira ENTERPRISE (which includes Atlassian Guard)\n\n3. Compare:\n   - **Total annual cost** and **per\u2011user cost**\n   - Plus value of Enterprise\u2011only capabilities and support.\n\n---\n\n### Practical rule of thumb\n\n- **Very small org (\u226410 users, 1 site)** and you just want SSO / security via Guard:  \n  \u2192 **FREE + Atlassian Guard add\u2011on** is structurally the cheapest *type* of setup, but you still need a Guard quote.\n\n- **Larger org or complex governance needs** (many users, many sites, strong compliance, advanced analytics):  \n  \u2192 You\u2019re likely comparing **STANDARD/PREMIUM + Guard** vs **ENTERPRISE**, and only Atlassian\u2019s quotes can tell you which is cheaper. Enterprise is designed as the \u201call\u2011inclusive\u201d bundle and is rarely the low-cost option for very small deployments.",

            "answer": "From the data available, this is what we can say with certainty:\n\n- **Box Enterprise**:  \n  - Public list price: **42 USD per user/month** (from the `ENTERPRISE` plan in the YAML).  \n  - Does **not** include Box Zones by default.  \n  - You can add **BOX_ZONES** as an add-on, but its price is listed as **\u201cContact Sales\u201d**, so no numeric amount is published.\n\n- **Box Enterprise Plus**:  \n  - Price: **\u201cContact Sales\u201d** (no public numeric price).  \n  - Includes **Box Zones** built in, plus a bundle of additional features and higher limits:\n    - Box Governance\n    - Box Zones\n    - Box Shield\n    - Box AI Q&A for Hubs\n    - Box AI Units (with a `boxAIUnitsLimit` of **2000 units/month**)\n    - Larger technical limits than Enterprise, e.g.:\n      - **Single file upload**: 150 GB (vs. 50 GB for Enterprise)\n      - **Version history**: unlimited (vs. 100 days for Enterprise)\n      - **Box Sign** documents via 3rd-party: unlimited (vs. 250)\n      - **Box Sign** documents for custom apps: 1000 (vs. 250)\n\n- **Box Zones add-on**:\n  - Add-on name: `BOX_ZONES`\n  - Available for: **BUSINESS_PLUS** and **ENTERPRISE**\n  - Price: **\u201cContact Sales\u201d** (no numeric amount)\n  - Only adds the **Box Zones** feature, nothing else.\n\n---\n\n### Can we say which is cheaper?\n\nNo: based on this pricing file, we **cannot** definitively say which is cheaper, because:\n\n- **Enterprise** is the only option with a public numeric price: **42 USD/user/month**.\n- Both **Enterprise Plus** and the **Box Zones add-on** are priced as **\u201cContact Sales\u201d**, i.e., custom quotes. There is no per\u2011user number to compare.\n\nMathematically, for *per-user/month* pricing:\n\n- **Enterprise + Zones** costs:  \n  `42 USD + (price of BOX_ZONES add-on)`\n- **Enterprise Plus** costs:  \n  `(price of ENTERPRISE_PLUS)`\n\nEnterprise + Zones is cheaper **only if**:  \n\n`42 + BOX_ZONES_price < ENTERPRISE_PLUS_price`.\n\nBecause neither `BOX_ZONES_price` nor `ENTERPRISE_PLUS_price` is published, we can\u2019t plug in real numbers.\n\n---\n\n### How to decide in practice\n\nUse this framework when you talk to Box sales:\n\n1. **If you only care about Box Zones** (data residency) and do *not* need:\n   - Box Governance  \n   - Box Shield  \n   - Box AI features & higher limits  \n\n   then you should ask for:\n   - A quote for **Enterprise (42 USD list) + BOX_ZONES**, and\n   - A quote for **Enterprise Plus** at your user count and contract term.\n\n   Whichever total per\u2011user/month number is lower wins. In many cases, **Enterprise + Zones** will be the economical choice if Zones is the only extra requirement.\n\n2. **If you also want Governance and/or Shield (or future AI features)**:\n   - To replicate Enterprise Plus using add-ons, you\u2019d effectively need:\n     - Enterprise (42 USD)  \n     + BOX_ZONES  \n     + BOX_GOVERNANCE  \n     + BOX_SHIELD  \n   - All three add-ons are \u201cContact Sales.\u201d\n\n   In that scenario, **Enterprise Plus is often positioned as the bundle that\u2019s cheaper than stacking multiple add-ons**, but you must confirm with an actual quote.\n\n---\n\n### What to explicitly ask Box\n\nWhen you contact Box, request:\n\n1. **Per\u2011user/month price for**:\n   - Enterprise (confirm the 42 USD list, plus any volume/term discounts for your org)\n   - BOX_ZONES add-on\n   - Enterprise Plus (for the same user count and term)\n\n2. **For your use case**, ask them to:\n   - Price **Scenario A**: Enterprise + Box Zones (and other add-ons you truly need)\n   - Price **Scenario B**: Enterprise Plus\n\nThen compare the per\u2011user and total contract cost.  \n\nWithout those custom quote numbers, the available pricing data doesn\u2019t allow a definitive \u201ccheaper vs. better deal\u201d answer\u2014only the structure and feature trade\u2011offs above.",

            "answer": "Here\u2019s the outcome of the pricing analysis for sending **~500 emails per month** under a **$60\u2013$84/year budget**.\n\n---\n\n## 1. What the optimizer found (and why it returned nothing)\n\nI ran an optimization over both pricing files with these constraints:\n\n- Monthly price between **$5 and $7** (\u2248 **$60\u2013$84/year**).\n- Email capacity of at least **500 emails/month**:\n  - Trustmary: `monthlyEmailRequestsLimit \u2265 500`\n  - Mailchimp: `monthlyEmailSends \u2265 500`\n\n**Result:**  \nFor both Trustmary and Mailchimp, **no plan matched those constraints**, which is why the tool returned:\n\n```json\n\"subscriptions\": [],\n\"cardinality\": 0\n```\n\nUsing the raw pricing data, we can see why and still answer your question.\n\n---\n\n## 2. Trustmary (\u201cFull Suite\u201d \u2013 using Collect pricing)\n\nThe provided YAML is for **\u201cTrustmary \u2013 Collect\u201d**. Within that:\n\n### Relevant email-related limits\n\nGlobal usage limit for email requests:\n\n- `monthlyEmailRequestsLimit` (linked to `emailSharing`):\n  - Default (for base/\u201cSOLO\u201d): **5 email requests/month**\n  - Per plan overrides:\n    - **STARTER**: 200 email requests/month\n    - **BUSINESS**: **500 email requests/month**\n    - **SCALE**: 5000 email requests/month\n\n### Plan prices (USD, per month)\n\nFrom the `plans` section:\n\n- **SOLO**: `price: 0 /month`\n- **STARTER**: `price: 16 /month`\n- **BUSINESS**: `price: 49 /month`\n- **SCALE**: `price: 107 /month`\n\n### Can Trustmary meet 500 emails/month within $60\u2013$84/year?\n\nTo reach **500 email requests/month**, you must use at least the **BUSINESS** plan:\n\n- **BUSINESS**\n  - Monthly price: **49 USD /month**\n  - Email capacity: **500 email requests/month**\n  - Annual cost: **49 \u00d7 12 = 588 USD/year**\n\nThis is **far above** your **$60\u2013$84/year** budget.\n\nCheaper Trustmary options:\n\n- **SOLO (0 USD/month; 0 USD/year)**  \n  - `monthlyEmailRequestsLimit` default: **5**  \n  - Does **not** meet 500 emails/month.\n- **STARTER (16 USD/month; 192 USD/year)**  \n  - `monthlyEmailRequestsLimit`: **200**  \n  - Closer, but still **below** 500 emails/month **and** above your budget.\n\n**Conclusion for Trustmary:**  \nWithin an annual budget of **$60\u2013$84**, **no Trustmary plan can provide 500 emails/month**.  \nThe **cheapest plan that meets 500/month** is **BUSINESS at 49 USD/month (588 USD/year)**, well outside your budget.\n\nAdd-ons like the **onboardingPackageAddOn (990 USD one-time)** would only increase total cost of ownership further and are also far beyond the budget range.\n\n---\n\n## 3. Mailchimp \u2013 Marketing\n\n### Global usage defaults\n\nFrom the `usageLimits` section:\n\n- `monthlyEmailSends`:\n  - Default: **2500 email/month**\n- `dailyEmailSends`:\n  - Default: **500 email/day**\n- `contactsLimit`:\n  - Default: **500 contacts**\n\nThese defaults apply to plans that don\u2019t override them \u2013 notably the **FREE** plan.\n\n### Plan prices (USD)\n\nFrom the `plans` section:\n\n- **FREE**\n  - Price: **0 /month**\n  - No custom usage limits listed \u2192 inherits defaults:\n    - **monthlyEmailSends: 2500 emails/month**\n    - **dailyEmailSends: 500 emails/day**\n- **ESSENTIALS**\n  - Price: **13 /month** (`unit: 500 users/month`)\n  - `monthlyEmailSends`: **500000**\n- **STANDARD**\n  - Price: **20 /month**\n  - `monthlyEmailSends`: **1200000**\n- **PREMIUM**\n  - Price: **350 /month**\n  - `monthlyEmailSends`: **\u221e (\".inf\")**\n\n### Can Mailchimp meet 500 emails/month within $60\u2013$84/year?\n\nYes, with the **FREE plan**:\n\n- **FREE**\n  - Monthly price: **0 USD /month**\n  - Annual cost: **0 USD/year**\n  - Email capacity: **2500 emails/month**\n\nThis comfortably covers your **500 emails/month** requirement at **zero subscription cost**, and is obviously within (actually *below*) your **$60\u2013$84/year** ceiling.\n\nThe optimizer didn\u2019t return this plan only because it was told to look for plans priced **between 5 and 7 USD/month**; at **0 USD/month**, FREE falls below that filter.\n\nAll paid Mailchimp plans exceed the budget:\n\n- **ESSENTIALS**: 13 \u00d7 12 = **156 USD/year**\n- **STANDARD**: 20 \u00d7 12 = **240 USD/year**\n- **PREMIUM**: 350 \u00d7 12 = **4200 USD/year**\n\nSo the **only** Mailchimp option within your budget is **FREE**, and it already meets your send-volume requirement.\n\nThere are no mandatory add-ons required to send these 500 emails/month; add-ons (like SMS marketing or transactional emails) are \u201cContact Sales\u201d and optional.\n\n---\n\n## 4.

Final answer: total cost of ownership within your budget\n\nUnder a **$60\u2013$84/year** budget and a requirement of **500 emails per month**:\n\n- **Trustmary (Full Suite / Collect):**\n  - No plan in this budget can support 500 emails/month.\n  - The **cheapest qualifying plan** is **BUSINESS at 49 USD/month (588 USD/year)**, *excluding* any optional onboarding or account-manager fees.\n  - **Effective TCO to meet your requirement:** **\u2248588 USD/year** (over budget).\n\n- **Mailchimp \u2013 Marketing:**\n  - The **FREE plan** (0 USD/month; 0 USD/year) supports **2500 email sends/month**, which more than covers 500 emails/month.\n  - No required add-ons for basic email sending.\n  - **Effective TCO to meet your requirement:** **0 USD/year** (well within budget).\n\n**Therefore, constrained to a $60\u2013$84 annual budget, Mailchimp \u2013 Marketing (FREE plan) is the only viable option for sending 500 emails per month; Trustmary cannot meet that requirement within this budget.**",

            "answer": "Here\u2019s what the data actually lets us say about the total cost of ownership (TCO) for **using single sign\u2011on (SSO)** in Trello vs. Wrike under an annual budget of **$144\u2013$312**.\n\nI\u2019ll assume (as in the optimization step) that this budget is **per user per year**, i.e. **$12\u2013$26 per user per month**.\n\n---\n\n## 1. Trello \u2013 Cost of SSO\n\n**Which plan includes SSO?**  \nFrom the Trello pricing YAML (`uploaded://pricing/1`):\n\n- The only plan with `singleSignOn: true` is **ENTERPRISE**.\n- The `BUSINESS_CLASS` plan does **not** have SSO.\n\n**Price with SSO**\n\nFrom the tool output and YAML:\n\n- **Trello ENTERPRISE**  \n  - `price: 20.83`  \n  - `unit: user/month`  \n  - SSO (`singleSignOn`) is included as a feature.\n- Annual per\u2011user cost:  \n  - 20.83 $/user/month \u00d7 12 months = **249.96 $/user/year**.\n\nThis sits squarely inside your target range of **$144\u2013$312 per user per year**.\n\n**What you get along with SSO (Trello ENTERPRISE)**  \nBesides SSO, ENTERPRISE bundles a broad set of admin and security features, e.g.:\n\n- Identity & access:\n  - `singleSignOn`: integration with providers like Microsoft Azure, OneLogin, Okta, and G Suite (per YAML description).\n  - `2factorAuthentication`\n  - `googleAppsSignOn`\n- Admin/security controls:\n  - `advancedAdminPermissions`\n  - `domainRestrictedInvites`\n  - `deactivateMembers`\n  - `simpleDataExport`\n  - `powerUpAdministration`\n  - `attachmentRestrictions`\n  - `organizationWidePermissions`\n  - `organizationVisibleBoards`\n  - `publicBoardManagement`\n  - `personalizedOnboarding`\n\nFrom a TCO perspective, you\u2019re not just paying for SSO; you\u2019re paying for a full enterprise security/admin suite at **~$250 per user per year** with transparent, numeric pricing.\n\n---\n\n## 2. Wrike \u2013 Cost of SSO\n\n**Which plan includes SSO?**\n\nFrom the Wrike pricing YAML (`uploaded://pricing/2`):\n\n- `singleSignOn: true` appears **only on the `ENTERPRISE` plan**.\n- Lower plans:\n  - **FREE**, **PROFESSIONAL**, **BUSINESS**, **MARKETERS**, **PROFESSIONAL_SERVICES** \u2013 **none** list `singleSignOn: true`.\n\nSo to meet an SSO requirement in Wrike, you must be on **Wrike ENTERPRISE**.\n\n**Price issue: \"Contact Sales\"**\n\nFor `ENTERPRISE`:\n\n```yaml\nENTERPRISE:\n  description: Comprehensive solution with advanced security & controls\n  price: Contact Sales\n  unit: 5 user/month\n```\n\n- The price is **not numeric**; it\u2019s `\"Contact Sales\"` per 5 users/month.\n- Because there\u2019s no numeric price, the optimization tool could not evaluate it under the `$12\u2013$26 per user/month` constraint and returned:\n\n> `\"error\": \"No solution found for the given filters.\"`\n\nThis doesn\u2019t mean no SSO plan exists; it means **the tool has no numeric price for any SSO\u2011enabled Wrike plan** to check against your budget.\n\n**What we *can* infer about magnitude (without inventing numbers)**\n\nThe nearest numeric reference is the **Wrike BUSINESS** plan (which does **not** include SSO):\n\n```yaml\nBUSINESS:\n  price: 124\n  unit: 5 user/month\n```\n\n- Implied per\u2011user price for BUSINESS (no SSO):  \n  - 124 $ / 5 users / month = **24.8 $/user/month**  \n  - Annual per\u2011user cost \u2248 24.8 \u00d7 12 = **297.6 $/user/year**.\n\nThat\u2019s **within** your $144\u2013$312 per\u2011user\u2011year range, but again: BUSINESS does *not* include SSO.  \n\nWrike ENTERPRISE (which does include SSO) is priced as `\"Contact Sales\"`, and the YAML gives **no numeric value**. It is almost certainly **not cheaper than BUSINESS**, but we cannot quantify it from the dataset.\n\n**Enterprise SSO package (Wrike)**\n\nFunctionally, Wrike ENTERPRISE\u2019s security/SSO bundle is richer and more security\u2011oriented than just SSO alone. It includes (among other features):\n\n- `singleSignOn` (SAML-based)\n- `activeDirectoryIntegration`\n- `twoFactorVerification`\n- `passwordPolicies`\n- `itControlAdminPermissions`\n- `userAuditReports`\n- `networkAccess&CompliancePolicies`\n- `businessIntelligenceIntegration`\n- `advancedUserAccessControls`\n\nFrom a TCO perspective, that\u2019s a more comprehensive security stack than Trello\u2019s, but since the price is not numeric, we **cannot verify** whether it fits $144\u2013$312 per user per year using the given data.\n\n---\n\n## 3. Direct Comparison within a $144\u2013$312 per\u2011user\u2011year Budget\n\nUnder the assumption that the budget applies **per user per year**, converted to **$12\u2013$26 per user per month**:\n\n### Trello\n\n- Cheapest SSO\u2011capable plan: **ENTERPRISE**.\n- Known price: **20.83 $/user/month** (billed annually).\n- Annual per\u2011user TCO for SSO: **249.96 $/user/year**.\n- This is **firmly within** your budget range.\n- You get SSO plus a broad set of enterprise admin/security features.\n\n### Wrike\n\n- Only SSO\u2011capable plan: **ENTERPRISE**.\n- Plan price: **\"Contact Sales\"** \u2013 no numeric value.\n- The optimizer returned *no solution* simply because it can\u2019t compare non\u2011numeric prices to the $12\u2013$26/month range.\n- Based on the YAML alone, we **cannot compute** annual per\u2011user cost or confirm whether it falls within $144\u2013$312.\n\nWe can say:\n\n- Business (no SSO) costs **~297.6 $/user/year**, which is inside your budget.\n- Enterprise (with SSO) is at least as expensive, and likely more\u2014but we have **no numeric value** to prove it fits the target range.\n\n---\n\n## 4. Practical Takeaway\n\nGiven only the pricing data provided:\n\n- **Trello ENTERPRISE** is the **only** option where:\n  - SSO is definitely included, **and**\n  - The price is explicitly known and **fits** the $144\u2013$312 per\u2011user\u2011year budget.\n\n- For **Wrike ENTERPRISE**, you would need to **contact Wrike sales** to:\n  - Obtain a numeric per\u2011user price,\n  - Then compare that to your $144\u2013$312 per\u2011user\u2011year budget.\n\nSo, if you must decide using *only* published/known prices under that budget constraint, Trello is the vendor you can confidently price for SSO; Wrike\u2019s SSO TCO cannot be established from the provided pricing data.",

            "answer": "Within your annual budget of **$72\u2013$180** and the requirement for **SAML single sign\u2011on**, the pricing data and optimization results lead to a clear outcome:\n\n---\n\n## 1. Notion\n\n### What the optimizer found\n\n- The solver, constrained to **$72\u2013$180** and requiring `samlSso`, selected:\n  - **Plan:** `BUSINESS`\n  - **Add\u2011on:** `customDomain`\n  - **Tool-reported total cost:**  \n    `\"Subscription cost includes add-ons with non-numeric prices, cannot calculate total cost. Please check the pricing data or contact sales.\"`\n\nThe \u201ccannot calculate\u201d status is because the **`customDomain` add\u2011on is priced \u201cContact Sales\u201d** (non\u2011numeric), so the tool can\u2019t produce a single numeric total.\n\n### Base subscription cost for SAML SSO\n\nFrom the Notion pricing YAML:\n\n- **Plan:** `BUSINESS`\n- **List price:** `18` **USD per user/month**\n- **Annual billing multiplier:** `billing.annually: 0.8`\n\nIf you buy BUSINESS on annual billing:\n\n- Effective monthly price per user on annual:  \n  `18 \u00d7 0.8 = 14.4 USD`\n- Effective annual price per user:  \n  `18 \u00d7 12 \u00d7 0.8 = 172.8 USD`\n\nSo:\n\n- **Per user, per year (BUSINESS, billed annually): ~\\$172.80**\n\nThis sits **inside your \\$72\u2013\\$180 annual budget** (but only for **one user**; two BUSINESS seats would already exceed \\$180).\n\n### SAML and related ownership considerations in Notion\n\n- Feature **`samlSso: true`** is included directly in the **BUSINESS** plan; the **customDomain** add\u2011on is *not* required to get SAML SSO.\n- BUSINESS also adds:\n  - **Priority support**\n  - **Advanced page analytics**, **verifyAnyPage**\n  - Stronger publishing and automation features (advanced SEO, site customization, custom database automations, etc.).\n\n**Total cost of ownership (TCO) for SAML SSO with Notion**, within your stated budget, looks like:\n\n- **Minimum subscription TCO (1 user, annual billing):** about **\\$172.80/year** for **Notion BUSINESS**.\n- **Unknown extras:** any optional add\u2011ons like:\n  - `customDomain` (priced \u201cContact Sales\u201d)\n  - `notionAi` (`10` USD per member/month)\n- **Not included in this comparison:** your identity provider\u2019s own costs (e.g., Okta, Azure AD) and internal admin time \u2014 those will generally apply regardless of whether you choose Notion or ClickUp.\n\n---\n\n## 2. ClickUp\n\n### What the optimizer found\n\nThe solver looked for a ClickUp subscription between **\\$72 and \\$180 annually** that includes **`customSamlSSO`** and reported:\n\n- **Result:** `\"No solution found for the given filters.\"`\n\n### Why no solution appeared\n\nFrom the ClickUp pricing YAML:\n\n- The SAML SSO capability is modeled as **`customSamlSSO`** (an identity provider integration).\n- Checking the plans:\n\n  - **FREE**: no SAML SSO\n  - **UNLIMITED**: no SAML SSO\n  - **BUSINESS**:\n    - Has **`googleSSO: true`** and stronger security features (e.g., `requireTwoFactorAuthentication: true`)\n    - **Does *not* enable `customSamlSSO`**\n  - **ENTERPRISE**:\n    - **`customSamlSSO: true`**\n    - Also `microsoftSSO`, `oktaSSO`, `scimProvisioning`, advanced permissions, data residency, etc.\n    - **Price:** `\"Contact Sales\"` (non\u2011numeric)\n\nBecause:\n\n1. **Only `ENTERPRISE` includes `customSamlSSO`,** and  \n2. `ENTERPRISE` is priced **\u201cContact Sales\u201d** (no numeric price),\n\nthe optimizer **cannot compute** a numeric total or even check whether ENTERPRISE would fall between **\\$72 and \\$180/year**. Hence the `\"No solution found\"` error under your constraints.\n\n### TCO implications for ClickUp\n\n- To get SAML SSO (`customSamlSSO`) you must be on **ENTERPRISE**, for which there is **no published price** in the YAML.\n- The **BUSINESS** plan does have a numeric price (for context):\n  - **Price:** `19` USD per member/month\n  - **Annual multiplier:** `billing.annual: 0.7`\n  - Effective annual per member: `19 \u00d7 12 \u00d7 0.7 = 159.6 USD`\n  - But **BUSINESS does not include `customSamlSSO`**, so it doesn\u2019t satisfy your SAML SSO requirement.\n- The actual **TCO for ClickUp with SAML SSO** is therefore:\n  - **Unknown from the provided data** (requires a quote from ClickUp Sales).\n  - Likely higher than BUSINESS (since ENTERPRISE is the top tier and is \u201cContact Sales\u201d), but we do not have any authoritative number.\n\n---\n\n## 3. Direct comparison under your budget constraint\n\n**Constraint:** Annual budget of **\\$72\u2013\\$180** total, with **SAML SSO required**.\n\n| Aspect                                | Notion                                   | ClickUp                                      |\n|--------------------------------------|------------------------------------------|----------------------------------------------|\n| Cheapest plan with SAML SSO          | **BUSINESS**                             | **ENTERPRISE**                               |\n| SAML feature flag                    | `samlSso: true`                          | `customSamlSSO: true`                        |\n| Numeric list price available?        | **Yes** (`18` USD/user/month)           | **No** for ENTERPRISE (price = \u201cContact Sales\u201d) |\n| Annual billing discount factor       | `billing.annually: 0.8`                 | `billing.annual: 0.7`                        |\n| Approx. annual per\u2011user (with SAML)  | **~\\$172.80** (BUSINESS, annual)        | **Not computable** from data                 |\n| Fits \\$72\u2013\\$180 band (1 user)?       | **Yes** (~\\$172.80)                     | **Unknown** (tool: \u201cNo solution found\u201d)      |\n\n### Interpretation\n\n- **Notion:**  \n  - For **1 user**, **Notion BUSINESS on annual billing (~\\$172.80/year)** is a **known, list\u2011priced option** that:\n    - Provides **SAML SSO**.\n    - Falls near the **top of your \\$72\u2013\\$180 budget range**.\n- **ClickUp:**  \n  - SAML SSO is **enterprise-only** and **not publicly priced** in the YAML.\n  - The optimization engine **could not find any numeric solution** within \\$72\u2013\\$180/year that includes `customSamlSSO`.\n  - You would need to **contact ClickUp Sales** to know whether an ENTERPRISE quote for your seat count could somehow fit that budget.\n\n---\n\n## 4. Bottom line\n\n- With the **data we have**, and **strictly enforcing SAML SSO plus a \\$72\u2013\\$180 annual budget**, **Notion is the only vendor with a clearly priced plan that fits**:\n  - Approximate TCO for SAML SSO (1 user, annual billing): **~\\$172.80/year** for **Notion BUSINESS**.\n- For **ClickUp**, SAML SSO requires **ENTERPRISE**, whose cost is **\u201cContact Sales\u201d**, so:\n  - **Total cost of ownership cannot be computed** from the available pricing data.\n  - There is no evidence from the tooling that a SAML\u2011enabled ClickUp plan exists within **\\$72\u2013\\$180/year**.\n\nIf your budget and requirement are both strict, **Notion BUSINESS (annual)** is the only option you can confidently plan around without engaging a sales conversation. If you are open to contacting vendors and potentially exceeding this range, you\u2019d need a direct ENTERPRISE quote from ClickUp to make a fair TCO comparison.",

            "answer": "Within an annual budget of \\$120\u2013\\$144, Buffer can support a Zapier integration; Crowdcast cannot. Here\u2019s how that comes out of the pricing data you provided.\n\n---\n\n## 1. What \u201cZapier integration\u201d looks like in each tool\n\n**Buffer**\n\n- Feature: `thirdPartyIntegrations`\n- Description: \u201cUse Buffer with your favorite apps like **Zapier**, IFTTT, Quuu, Pocket, Feedly, and more.\u201d\n- Default: `true` (enabled by default on plans that don\u2019t override it)\n\nSo any Buffer plan that includes `thirdPartyIntegrations` effectively supports Zapier.\n\n**Crowdcast**\n\n- Feature: `zapierIntegration`\n- Description: \u201cSync your Crowdcast account with 5,000+ other web apps through automated workflows.\u201d\n- Default: `false` (you only get it on specific paid tiers)\n\n---\n\n## 2. Buffer + Zapier: cost within \\$120\u2013\\$144/year\n\nFrom the Buffer YAML:\n\n- Currency: USD\n- Billing: monthly\n\nRelevant plans/add\u2011ons:\n\n- **FREE**  \n  - Price: `0` account/month  \n  - Features: `null` \u2192 uses defaults; `thirdPartyIntegrations` has `defaultValue: true`, so Zapier is available.\n  - Annual cost: **\\$0**\n\n- **ESSENTIALS**  \n  - Price: `6` account/month \u2192 **\\$72/year**  \n  - Does not disable `thirdPartyIntegrations`, so Zapier is included here as well.\n\n- **teamPack add\u2011on** (for ESSENTIALS)  \n  - Price: `6` account (per month, under monthly billing context)  \n  - Adds team features (additional users, approvals, etc.), but Zapier remains available via `thirdPartyIntegrations`.\n\n**Optimized plan in your requested budget band**\n\nUsing your constraint of **\\$10\u2013\\$12/month** (i.e., \\$120\u2013\\$144/year) and requiring third\u2011party integrations, the optimal combination that the solver found is:\n\n- **Buffer \u201cESSENTIALS\u201d plan + \u201cteamPack\u201d add\u2011on**  \n  - Base plan: 6 USD/month  \n  - Add\u2011on: 6 USD/month  \n  - Total: **\u201c12 $\u201d per month** \u2192 **\\$144/year**\n\nThis satisfies:\n\n- The budget constraint (in the upper part of your \\$120\u2013\\$144 range).\n- The requirement for Zapier integration (through `thirdPartyIntegrations`).\n\n**Important nuance:**  \nIf your budget of \\$120\u2013\\$144 is a **maximum** rather than a strict band you must \u201chit,\u201d Buffer is actually even more favorable:\n\n- **Cheapest Zapier\u2011capable option:** FREE plan \u2192 **\\$0/year**.\n- **Mid\u2011tier Zapier\u2011capable option:** ESSENTIALS alone \u2192 **\\$72/year**.\n- **Top of your specified range:** ESSENTIALS + teamPack \u2192 **\\$144/year**.\n\nIn all of these, Zapier is supported via `thirdPartyIntegrations`.\n\n---\n\n## 3. Crowdcast + Zapier: cost vs. the same budget\n\nFrom the Crowdcast YAML:\n\n- Currency: USD\n- Billing: monthly\n- `zapierIntegration` is **only** enabled on:\n\n1. **LITE**  \n   - Price: `49` /month \u2192 **\\$588/year**  \n   - Includes `zapierIntegration: true`.\n\n2. **PRO**  \n   - Price: `89` /month \u2192 **\\$1,068/year**  \n   - Includes `zapierIntegration: true`.\n\n3. **BUSINESS**  \n   - Price: `199` /month \u2192 **\\$2,388/year**  \n   - Includes `zapierIntegration: true`.\n\nThe **STARTER** plan at `29` /month has `features: null`, and the `zapierIntegration` feature has `defaultValue: false`, so **STARTER does not include Zapier**.\n\nWhen the optimizer searched for a Crowdcast plan:\n\n- With `zapierIntegration`, and  \n- Priced in the **\\$10\u2013\\$12/month** range (your \\$120\u2013\\$144/year band),\n\nit returned: **\u201cNo solution found for the given filters.\u201d**\n\nThis matches the raw pricing data: **the cheapest Crowdcast plan with Zapier is \\$49/month**, far above your budget ceiling.\n\n---\n\n## 4. Total cost of ownership comparison (host app only)\n\nIgnoring Zapier\u2019s own subscription (which would be the **same** regardless of Buffer vs. Crowdcast and is only linked via URLs in the YAML, not priced), the annual host\u2011app cost to get a Zapier integration is:\n\n| Product        | Cheapest Zapier\u2011capable option | Monthly   | Annual   | Within \\$120\u2013\\$144? |\n|----------------|--------------------------------|-----------|----------|----------------------|\n| **Buffer**     | FREE (via `thirdPartyIntegrations`) | \\$0       | \\$0      | **Yes** (under cap) |\n|                | ESSENTIALS                     | \\$6       | \\$72     | Yes                  |\n|                | ESSENTIALS + teamPack (tool\u2019s optimal in band) | **12 $** | **\\$144** | **Yes** (top of band) |\n| **Crowdcast**  | LITE (first with `zapierIntegration`) | \\$49      | \\$588    | **No**               |\n\n---\n\n## 5. Conclusion\n\n- **Within a \\$120\u2013\\$144 annual budget**, only **Buffer** can provide a Zapier integration.  \n  - Under a strict \\$10\u2013\\$12/month band, the optimal configuration from your data is **Buffer ESSENTIALS + teamPack at 12 $/month (\\$144/year)**.  \n  - If you treat \\$144 as a maximum rather than a target, you can integrate Buffer with Zapier for as little as **\\$0/year** (FREE) or **\\$72/year** (ESSENTIALS).\n\n- **Crowdcast** cannot meet that budget constraint for Zapier integration at all: the minimum is **\\$588/year** on the LITE plan, before adding any Zapier subscription cost.\n\nSo from a total cost of ownership standpoint under your budget, **Buffer + Zapier is viable; Crowdcast + Zapier is not.**",

            "answer": "Within an annual budget of **$84\u2013$108** (\u2248 **$7\u2013$9/month**), **neither Box nor Dropbox can provide 3,000 GB (3 TB) of storage** based on the pricing data we have.\n\nBelow is what the analysis shows and what the *actual* total cost of ownership (TCO) would be if you relax the budget.\n\n---\n\n## 1. What the optimization tools found\n\nI ran an optimization for both Box and Dropbox with these constraints:\n\n- **Price filter:** minPrice = 7, maxPrice = 9 (USD per month \u2192 $84\u2013$108/year)\n- **Usage requirement:** storageLimit \u2265 3000 GB\n- **Objective:** minimize price\n\nFor **both**:\n```json\n\"result\": { \"error\": \"No solution found for the given filters.\" }\n```\n\nThis means:  \n> **There is no Box or Dropbox plan priced between $7 and $9 per month that offers at least 3,000 GB of storage.**\n\nI then inspected the raw pricing YAML to see what the *cheapest possible* qualifying plans actually are.\n\n---\n\n## 2. Dropbox: cost for 3,000 GB\n\nFrom the Dropbox YAML (snapshot 2022\u201111\u201116):\n\nRelevant individual/SMB plans:\n\n- **PLUS**\n  - Price: **9.99 USD /month**\n  - Storage: uses default `storageLimit: 2000 GB` (2 TB)\n  - Not enough capacity for 3 TB.\n  - Annual cost: 9.99 \u00d7 12 = **119.88 USD** (already above your $108 cap and still only 2 TB).\n\n- **PROFESSIONAL**\n  - Price: **16.58 USD /month**\n  - `storageLimit: 3000` \u2192 **3,000 GB**\n  - This is the **cheapest** Dropbox plan that meets the 3 TB requirement.\n  - Annual cost: 16.58 \u00d7 12 = **198.96 USD**\n\n- **STANDARD (team)**\n  - Price: **45 USD / 3 user/month**\n  - `storageLimit: 5000` \u2192 5,000 GB\n  - Annual cost: 45 \u00d7 12 = **540 USD**\n\n- **ADVANCED (team, unlimited storage)**\n  - Price: **72 USD / 3 user/month**\n  - `storageLimit: .inf` (unlimited)\n  - Annual cost: 72 \u00d7 12 = **864 USD**\n\n**Conclusion for Dropbox:**\n\n- **No plan** provides 3 TB within **$84\u2013$108/year**.\n- The **cheapest way** to get 3 TB from Dropbox is:\n  - **PROFESSIONAL** at **198.96 USD/year**\n  - Effective cost \u2248 **$0.066 per GB per year** at 3 TB.\n\n---\n\n## 3. Box: cost for 3,000 GB\n\nFrom the Box YAML (snapshot 2022\u201111\u201129):\n\nGlobal default:\n- `storageLimit` default: **100 GB**\n\nPlans:\n\n- **BUSINESS_STARTER**\n  - Price: **15 USD / 3 users/month**\n  - No plan\u2011level override, so storage = default **100 GB**\n  - Not enough for 3 TB.\n  - Annual cost: 15 \u00d7 12 = **180 USD** (but capacity far below 3 TB).\n\n- **BUSINESS**\n  - Price: **45 USD / 3 user/month**\n  - `storageLimit: .inf` \u2192 **unlimited storage**\n  - This is the **cheapest Box plan** that can store 3 TB.\n  - Annual cost: 45 \u00d7 12 = **540 USD**\n\n- **BUSINESS_PLUS**\n  - Price: **75 USD / 3 users/month**\n  - `storageLimit: .inf` (unlimited)\n  - Annual cost: 75 \u00d7 12 = **900 USD**\n\n- **ENTERPRISE**\n  - Price: **105 USD / 3 users/month**\n  - `storageLimit: .inf` (unlimited)\n  - Annual cost: 105 \u00d7 12 = **1260 USD**\n\n- **ENTERPRISE_PLUS**\n  - Price: **Contact Sales** (no concrete number; cannot compute TCO)\n\n**Conclusion for Box:**\n\n- **No Box plan** that can store 3 TB falls inside **$84\u2013$108/year**.\n- The **cheapest Box plan** that can hold 3 TB is:\n  - **BUSINESS** at **540 USD/year**\n  - Even if you only need storage for one person, you must pay for the 3\u2011user unit.\n  - Effective cost at 3 TB \u2248 **$0.18 per GB per year**.\n\n---\n\n## 4. Direct comparison under your budget constraint\n\n**Budget constraint:** $84\u2013$108 per year (\u2248 $7\u2013$9/month)\n\n- **Dropbox**\n  - Cheapest 3 TB\u2011capable plan: **PROFESSIONAL at 198.96 USD/year** \u2192 **over budget**.\n- **Box**\n  - Cheapest 3 TB\u2011capable plan: **BUSINESS at 540 USD/year** \u2192 **far over budget**.\n\n**Result:**\n\n- **Within $84\u2013$108 annually, neither Box nor Dropbox can provide 3,000 GB of storage.**\n- If you relax the budget:\n  - Dropbox\u2019s 3 TB option (**Professional, ~199 USD/year**) is **much cheaper** than Box\u2019s first unlimited option (**Business, 540 USD/year**).\n\n---\n\n### Practical takeaway\n\n- With a **hard cap of $108/year**, **3 TB is not achievable** with either Box or Dropbox based on the 2022 pricing data.\n- If you can raise the budget to around **$200/year**, **Dropbox Professional** is the lower\u2011TCO option for 3 TB.\n- If your use case demands Box\u2011specific enterprise features or unlimited scaling, you\u2019d be looking at **~$540/year and up**.",

Every plan (including `FREE`) has `usageLimits: null`, and there is no `maxUsers` or `usersPerAccount` field.  \n   - Interpretation: With the data you provided, the FREE plan has:\n     - Price per user/month = **0 USD**\n     - No modeled cap on the number of users  \n     \u2192 101+ users at $0/user/month still fits comfortably within a $187/month budget.\n\n2. **Box (uploaded://pricing/2)**  \n   - Optimization run: minimize cost with:\n     - `maxPrice = 187`\n     - `usageLimits: [{ usersPerAccount: 101 }]` (i.e., need \u2265101 users)\n   - Result:  \n     - `\"error\": \"No solution found for the given filters.\"`  \n   - Why no solution?\n     - From the Box YAML:\n       - Global `usersPerAccount` default: **3**\n       - Plans:\n         - `STARTER`: **15 USD** per **\"3 users/month\"**, maxUsers default is 10 \u2192 cannot reach 101 users on STARTER at all.\n         - `BUSINESS`: **45 USD** per **\"3 users/month\"`; extra users via `extraUserBusiness` at **15 USD/user/month**.  \n           - Effective cost is 15 USD per user:\n             - 3 users = 45 USD  \n             - N users = 45 + 15\u00b7(N\u20133) = 15\u00b7N  \n           - For 101 users: 15 \u00d7 101 = **1,515 USD/month**, far above 187 USD.\n         - `BUSINESS_PLUS`: **75 USD** per **\"3 users/month\"`; extra users via `extraUserBusinessPlus` at **25 USD/user/month**  \n           - Effective cost \u2248 25 USD per user \u2192 101 users \u2248 **2,525 USD/month**.\n       - `ENTERPRISE` and `extraUserEnterprise` are \u201cContact Sales\u201d, so the solver won\u2019t price them explicitly and can\u2019t produce a constrained optimum under $187.\n     - Conclusion: There is **no combination** of Box base plans and priced add-ons that gets you to **101 users at \u2264187 USD/month**, which matches the solver error.\n\n### Direct comparison within a $187 budget for 100+ users\n\n- **ClickUp FREE plan**\n  - Modeled price: **0 $** (per user/month)\n  - No encoded user cap in YAML (no `maxUsers`, `usersPerAccount`, etc.).\n  - Core capabilities included:\n    - Task management (`tasks`)\n    - Storage (`storage`)\n    - Basic views (`views`)\n    - API access (`api`)\n  - Under the assumptions of your pricing data, you can add **more than 100 users** for **0 USD/month**, well under your **$187** initial budget.\n\n- **Box (any plan)**\n  - To support >100 users:\n    - **Starter** cannot exceed about 10 users (via `maxUsers` default).\n    - **Business** supports unlimited users but at **\u224815 USD/user/month**, so **101 users \u2248 1,515 USD/month**.\n    - **Business Plus** is even more expensive; Enterprise is unpriced (\u201cContact Sales\u201d).\n  - Therefore, **Box cannot satisfy the 101-user requirement under a 187 USD/month budget** given this pricing.\n\n### Recommendation\n\nWithin a **$187 initial budget** and a priority on **getting 100+ users onto the platform**, your best\u2014and effectively only\u2014viable path from the provided pricing data is:\n\n- **Use ClickUp\u2019s FREE plan** to onboard your >100 users.\n\nBox only becomes realistic at a much higher budget (on the order of **$1,500+/month** for ~100 users on the Business tier), whereas ClickUp\u2019s FREE plan gives you basic work management and collaboration for unlimited users at **0 $**.",

            "answer": "Trello is the clearly better path for a startup that *must* have single sign-on and wants to stay within a **$129** initial (monthly) budget.\n\n### What the optimization found\n\n**Trello**\n\n- The pricing optimizer, constrained to `maxPrice: 129` and requiring `singleSignOn`, returned:\n\n  ```json\n  {\n    \"bestPlan\": {\n      \"plan\": \"FREE\",\n      \"cost\": \"3 $\",\n      \"addOns\": [\"ATLASSIAN_ACCESS\"]\n    }\n  }\n  ```\n\n- Concretely, from the Trello pricing YAML:\n  - **Plan**: `FREE`  \n    - `price: 0` (unit: `user/month`)\n  - **Add-on**: `ATLASSIAN_ACCESS`\n    - `price: 3` (unit: `user/month`, currency: USD)\n    - Features it enables:\n      - `singleSignOn: true`\n      - `enforce2FA: true`\n  - The base `singleSignOn` feature describes Atlassian Access as:\n    > \"...starts at $3/month/user\"\n\n- So the cheapest way to get SSO on Trello is:\n  - **Trello FREE + Atlassian Access**\n  - **Cost**: `\"3 $\"` per user per month (3 USD/user/month in the YAML)\n  - This satisfies the SSO requirement and is far below the $129 cap.\n\n**Wrike**\n\n- The optimizer, under the same constraints (`maxPrice: 129`, `features: [\"singleSignOn\"]`), returned:\n\n  ```json\n  {\"error\":\"No solution found for the given filters.\"}\n  ```\n\n- From the Wrike YAML:\n  - `singleSignOn` is **only** included in:\n    - `ENTERPRISE`\n    - `PINNACLE`\n  - Both have `price: Contact Sales` (no concrete amount), and:\n    - `ENTERPRISE` usage limits: `minNumberOfUsers: 5`\n    - `PINNACLE` usage limits: `minNumberOfUsers: 5`\n  - The priced plans:\n    - `FREE`: no SSO\n    - `PROFESSIONAL`: `price: 49`, `unit: 5 user/month`, **no** SSO\n    - `BUSINESS`: `price: 124`, `unit: 5 user/month`, **no** SSO\n\n- Because no **priced** Wrike plan includes `singleSignOn`, the solver has no way to confirm a Wrike SSO option under $129. Hence, `\"No solution found\"`.\n\n### How this compares against your $129 budget\n\nAssuming the budget is monthly and using the provided pricing snapshot:\n\n**Trello path (with SSO):**\n\n- Per user:\n  - Trello FREE: $0\n  - Atlassian Access: 3 $ (3 USD)\n  - **Total with SSO**: 3 $ / user / month\n- Within a 129 $ budget, you could theoretically support up to:\n  - `129 / 3 \u2248 43` users on **Trello FREE + Atlassian Access** and still stay at or under your budget.\n- If you later need richer Trello features (dashboards, advanced views, etc.), you could move some or all users to:\n  - `PREMIUM`: `price: 10` (unit: `user/month`), which in the YAML directly sets `singleSignOn: true` as part of the plan.\n\n**Wrike path (with SSO):**\n\n- SSO only appears on `ENTERPRISE` and `PINNACLE`:\n  - Both are listed as **\u201cContact Sales\u201d**, not priced.\n  - The optimizer could not produce a solution under `maxPrice: 129` because there is no explicit price to compare.\n- Practically, that means:\n  - You cannot, from this pricing data, guarantee an SSO-capable Wrike plan that fits a 129 $ startup budget.\n  - The only Wrike plan near your budget with a published price is `BUSINESS` at 124 $ for 5 users, but it **does not include singleSignOn**.\n\n### Conclusion\n\n- **Best choice within a $129 initial budget, prioritizing SSO:** **Trello**  \n  - Use **Trello FREE + the `ATLASSIAN_ACCESS` add-on**, which the optimizer found as:\n    - `plan: \"FREE\"`\n    - `addOns: [\"ATLASSIAN_ACCESS\"]`\n    - `cost: \"3 $\"` per user/month, including `singleSignOn`.\n- **Why not Wrike?**\n  - Wrike only exposes SSO on `ENTERPRISE` and `PINNACLE`, both \u201cContact Sales\u201d with no price; the optimizer found **no valid SSO plan under 129 $**.\n  - You would be forced into an unpriced, enterprise-tier engagement to get SSO.\n\nIf your non-SSO requirements are modest and budget is tight, Trello with Atlassian Access gives you enterprise-grade SSO and 2FA enforcement at the lowest concrete cost and scales comfortably within your $129 cap.",

Please check the pricing data or contact sales.\"**\n  - In the YAML, `ENTERPRISE` has `price: Contact Sales`, so we cannot verify it\u2019s within 137.\n- Commenting features (`addCommentsToDesigns`, `bluitInCommenting`) have `defaultValue: true`, so they exist on **all** plans, including:\n  - **`FREE`** \u2013 price **0**\n  - **`PRO`** \u2013 **12.95 USD/user/month**\n\nWithin **$137/month** on **Canva PRO** you can afford:\n\n- **10 users**: 10 \u00d7 12.95 = **129.50 USD** (11 would exceed 137)\n\nFor **Canva ENTERPRISE**, there is no numeric price; the tool explicitly failed to compute a total due to the non\u2011numeric \u201cContact Sales\u201d price, so we can\u2019t say it fits your budget.\n\n---\n\n### Comparing pure commenting & collaboration\n\nFrom the pricing data:\n\n- **Figma**\n  - `onCanvasCommenting: defaultValue: true` \u2013 available even on **`STARTER` (0 USD/editor/month)**.\n  - Real\u2011time collaboration via `multiplayer` and `shareableLinks`.\n  - Designed around a single shared canvas for UI/product designs with comments anchored directly on frames/prototypes.\n\n- **Canva**\n  - `addCommentsToDesigns: defaultValue: true`\n  - `bluitInCommenting: defaultValue: true`\n  - Both are present even on **`FREE` (0 USD/user/month)**.\n  - Aimed at general graphics and marketing creatives, with comments on designs.\n\nFor **basic commenting alone**, both tools meet your requirement on their **free tiers**.\n\n---\n\n### Cost\u2013effectiveness for a startup under $137\n\nWhen you move beyond \u201cjust commenting\u201d and start paying for power users:\n\n- **Per\u2011seat pricing**\n  - Figma PROFESSIONAL: **12 USD/editor/month**\n  - Canva PRO: **12.95 USD/user/month**\n\nUnder **$137**:\n\n- Figma PROFESSIONAL:\n  - Up to **11 editors** (132 USD)  \n- Canva PRO:\n  - Up to **10 users** (129.50 USD)\n\nFigma is slightly **cheaper per editor** and yields **more paid editing seats** under the same budget.\n\nFor enterprise\u2011style governance:\n\n- **Figma ORGANIZATION**:\n  - **`price: 45`** per editor/month (tool: `45 $`)\n  - You can clearly fund **3 editors** (3 \u00d7 45 $ = 135 $) under a 137 $ budget.\n  - Adds SSO, `teams`, `organizationWideDesignSystems`, `pluginManagement`, `activityLogs`, etc.\n\n- **Canva ENTERPRISE**:\n  - `price: Contact Sales`  \n  - Tool result: *\u201ccannot calculate total cost\u201d* \u2013 we **cannot** confirm it fits 137 $ at all, even for a single seat.\n\nSo for anything beyond the totally free level, **Figma has transparent, known prices that fit your budget; Canva\u2019s enterprise tier does not.**\n\n---\n\n### Recommended path\n\nGiven your priority (\u201ccommenting designs and canvases\u201d) and a **$137 initial monthly budget**:\n\n**Choose Figma as your primary design/commenting platform.**\n\nConcrete path:\n\n1. **Start on Figma `STARTER` (0 USD/editor/month)**  \n   - You already get `onCanvasCommenting`, `multiplayer`, `shareableLinks`, and 30\u2011day `versionHistoryDepth`.\n   - This alone lets a small startup comment on shared designs and canvases at **zero cost**.\n\n2. **Upgrade core designers to `PROFESSIONAL` (12 USD/editor/month) as you grow**  \n   - Adds `privateProjects`, `prototypeSharingPermissions`, `teamLibraries`, unlimited version history.\n   - Under 137 $, you can support up to **11 editing designers**; stakeholders can still comment on shared files without additional editor seats.\n\n3. **Consider `ORGANIZATION` (45 $/editor/month) only if you need enterprise controls**  \n   - Under 137 $, you can get **3 ORGANIZATION editors** and retain all commenting features.\n   - This is the only enterprise\u2011level path here whose cost we can **actually verify** fits within your budget.\n\nYou can still use **Canva FREE (0 USD)** alongside Figma for lightweight marketing graphics; its commenting is also available for free. But for a startup whose main priority is robust commenting on design canvases, **Figma offers the clearer, cheaper, and more scalable pricing path within a $137 budget.**",

Even without a structured pricing spec here, its public positioning focuses on:\n\n- Books / accounting and invoicing\n- Inventory and order management\n- HR, attendance, payroll\n- CRM and basic email/marketing automation\n\nWhile Deskera can automate many **back\u2011office and operational** workflows, it does **not** (based on its marketing up to now) emphasize:\n\n- A workspace\u2011wide AI assistant embedded into tasks, docs, whiteboards, and chat.\n- Rich, AI\u2011assisted content creation workflows (e.g., drafting docs, brainstorming, summarization) as a core product pillar.\n\nFor an early\u2011stage startup trying to:\n\n- Put AI into **daily collaboration and execution**, and\n- Improve **the quality and speed of their content**,\n\nan ERP suite is **too narrow and back\u2011office\u2011focused** to be your main \u201cAI everywhere\u201d layer. It might become valuable later when you need robust financials, inventory, and HR; but as a first investment for AI\u2011driven productivity and content, it\u2019s misaligned.\n\n---\n\n## Recommendation\n\n**Choose ClickUp, not Deskera\u2011ERP, as your foundational AI\u2011centric SaaS right now.**\n\n**Concrete path within your $152 budget:**\n\n- Start with **ClickUp UNLIMITED** plus:\n  - **ClickUp AI** enabled, and\n  - **1 extra email account in ClickUp** per workspace (as chosen in the optimized config).\n- Budget for **up to 8 seats** at **17 $/member/month** = **136 $/month**.\n- Use ClickUp as:\n  - Your **project and task hub** (with AI assistance).\n  - Your **internal content workspace** (Docs, Wiki, Whiteboards, Chat) with AI for drafting, summarizing, and refining.\n  - Your **automation layer** (Automations + AI) across day\u2011to\u2011day workflows.\n\nYou can always layer in an ERP like Deskera later when your operations require it; but for maximizing AI\u2011driven productivity and content from day one, **ClickUp UNLIMITED + ClickUp AI** is the clearly better, more cost\u2011effective starting point.",

It found:\n    - **Cheapest plan under 26 $/user:** `STARTER` at `12 $` user/month.\n    - However, its feature list contains no `emailSupport`, and no Quip plan in the YAML adds such a feature.\n  - Under a strict \u201cemail support is mandatory\u201d requirement, **Quip has no plan that can be confirmed to satisfy that constraint** from the provided pricing data.\n\n**Conclusion**\n\nGiven that email support is mandatory and cost-per-user must be below 26 $:\n\n- **Evernote PREMIUM at 7.99 $ per month per user** is the **cost-minimizing and only qualifying choice** between Evernote and Quip.",

Hence, no Deskera plan can satisfy both \u201cworkflow/builtin automation is mandatory\u201d and \u201ccost-per-user < 104\u201d.\n\n**Conclusion**\n\n- **Trello**: Meets the automation requirement and costs **`0 $` per user/month** on the FREE plan \u2192 **valid and optimal**.\n- **Deskera - ERP**: All eligible plans with `workflowAutomation` are **\u2265 199 user/month**, so **no valid option under 104**.\n\nTherefore, when builtin automation is mandatory and cost-per-user must stay below $104, **Trello (FREE plan at 0 $ per user/month)** is the cost-minimizing\u2014and in practice, the only feasible\u2014choice.",

All we can guarantee from this data is encryption and user\u2011limit caps.\n\n---\n\n## 2025 configuration (pricing file version `2025`)\n\n**Requirements applied:**  \n- `encryptionInTransitAndAtRest`  \n- `userCounts`\n\nFrom the 2025 YAML:\n\n- `encryptionInTransitAndAtRest`: `defaultValue: true` \u2192 provided by **all** plans.\n- `userCounts`: `defaultValue: false` and is **only set to `true` in the ENTERPRISE plan**.\n\nThe optimization step (minizinc, objective `minimize`, filters `[\"encryptionInTransitAndAtRest\", \"userCounts\"]`) returned:\n\n- **Most cost\u2011effective *feasible* plan:** **ENTERPRISE**\n- **Reported cost from the tool:**  \n  `Subscription cost includes non-numeric plan price, cannot calculate total cost. Please check the pricing data or contact sales.`\n- **Why ENTERPRISE is chosen:**\n  - All plans (FREE, STANDARD, PREMIUM, ENTERPRISE) satisfy encryption in transit and at rest.\n  - Only **ENTERPRISE** explicitly includes `userCounts: true` in its feature list:\n    ```yaml\n    ENTERPRISE:\n      features:\n        userCounts:\n          value: true\n    ```\n  - No add\u2011on in the 2025 file adds `userCounts` to cheaper plans. Therefore, **ENTERPRISE is the only configuration** that satisfies both required features, making it the \u201cmost cost\u2011effective\u201d option simply because it is the only valid one.\n\n**Additional ENTERPRISE 2025 details from the YAML:**\n\n- **Price field:** `price: Contact Sales` (non\u2011numeric)  \n  \u2192 the tooling cannot compute a concrete monthly or annual cost; you must obtain a quote from Atlassian.\n- **Usage limits:**\n  - `usersLimit`: 50,000\n  - `sitesLimit`: 150\n  - Unlimited or very high automation, storage, and email limits (all `.inf` in the YAML).\n\n---\n\n## Direct answer\n\n- **2020:**  \n  The most cost\u2011effective configuration that provides **encryption in transit and at rest** is the **Jira CLOUD FREE plan** (2020\u201111\u201129), at **`0` USD per user/month**, up to 10 users, 1 site, and 2 GB storage.

            "answer": "Here\u2019s the most cost\u2011effective setup in each year, given your requirements.\n\n---\n\n## 2019 pricing (premier support required, super admin not available)\n\n**Key limitation:**  \nIn the 2019 Zapier pricing data, there is **no `superAdmin` feature defined on any plan**. So your exact requirement (\u201cpremier support and super admin\u201d) cannot be fully met in 2019. We can only optimize for **premierSupport**.\n\n**Most cost\u2011effective 2019 configuration**\n\n- **Plan:** `TEAM`\n- **Cost:** `373.75 $` per month (2019 pricing snapshot)\n- **Why this plan:**\n  - In 2019, only **TEAM** and **COMPANY** include the `premierSupport` feature.\n  - **TEAM** is priced at 373.75 $/month, while **COMPANY** is 748.75 $/month.\n  - Since both include `premierSupport` and there are **no add\u2011ons** in 2019 (`addOns: null`), **TEAM** is the cheapest way to get premier support.\n- **Feature coverage vs. your requirements:**\n  - `premierSupport`: **Yes** (included in TEAM)\n  - `superAdmin`: **No** (not present in the 2019 feature set at all)\n\nSo for 2019, the best you can do with the available features is **TEAM at 373.75 $/month**, giving you premier support but **no super\u2011admin capability**.\n\n---\n\n## 2024 pricing (premier support **and** super admin required)\n\nIn the 2024 data, both `premierSupport` and `superAdmin` are explicit features.\n\nLooking at the plans:\n\n- **PROFESSIONAL**: does **not** include `premierSupport` or `superAdmin`.\n- **TEAM**:\n  - Includes `premierSupport`\n  - Does **not** include `superAdmin`\n- **ENTERPRISE**:\n  - Includes **both** `premierSupport` and `superAdmin`\n  - Also adds other enterprise admin/security features (e.g., `samlSingleSignOn`, `userProvisioning`, `domainCapture`, `advancedAdminPermissions`, audit logs, etc.)\n\nNo add\u2011on in 2024 adds either `premierSupport` or `superAdmin` (add\u2011ons are for SAML SSO on TEAM, and \u201cpremium\u201d Tables/Interfaces/Chatbots only), so you **cannot** bolt `superAdmin` onto TEAM or PROFESSIONAL.\n\n**Most cost\u2011effective 2024 configuration**\n\n- **Plan:** `ENTERPRISE`\n- **Cost:**  \n  - The pricing entry is **non\u2011numeric**: `price: Contact Sales`\n  - The optimizer returns:  \n    `Subscription cost includes non-numeric plan price, cannot calculate total cost. Please check the pricing data or contact sales.`\n- **Why this plan:**\n  - **ENTERPRISE is the only plan that has both `premierSupport` and `superAdmin`.**\n  - Since neither TEAM nor PROFESSIONAL can reach that feature set even with add\u2011ons, ENTERPRISE is **necessarily** the least\u2011cost configuration that satisfies *both* of your requirements.\n- **Feature coverage vs. your requirements:**\n  - `premierSupport`: **Yes**\n  - `superAdmin`: **Yes**\n\nIf you were willing to drop the `superAdmin` requirement, the cheapest plan with `premierSupport` alone in 2024 would be **TEAM at 446.27 USD/month**, but that does **not** satisfy your stated need.\n\n---\n\n## Summary\n\n- **2019:**  \n  - Exact requirement (premier support + super admin): **not achievable** (no `superAdmin` feature exists).  \n  - Best approximation: **TEAM**, **373.75 $/month**, includes `premierSupport` but not `superAdmin`.\n\n- **2024:**  \n  - Exact requirement (premier support + super admin): **ENTERPRISE** plan.  \n  - Cost is **\u201cContact Sales\u201d** / non\u2011numeric; tooling cannot compute a dollar amount. It is, however, the **only** configuration that satisfies both `premierSupport` and `superAdmin`.",

            "answer": "For both 2024 and 2025, the most cost\u2011effective configuration that satisfies your requirements is:\n\n- **Plan:** `FREE`  \n- **Add\u2011ons:** none (`addOns: []`)  \n- **Cost (per month):** `0 $`  \n\nThis is true for **both** the 2024 and 2025 pricing files.\n\n---\n\n### Why this is optimal\n\nThe optimization was run separately for each year with these required features:\n\n- **2024:** `componentsRelease` + `concurrentJobRuns`  \n- **2025:** `releases` + `concurrentJobRuns`  \n\nIn both cases, the solver found the optimal subscription:\n\n```json\n\"subscription\": {\n  \"plan\": \"FREE\",\n  \"addOns\": [],\n  \"cost\": \"0 $\",\n  ...\n}\n```\n\nNo paid plan (e.g., `PERFORMANCE` at `15 /month` or `SCALE`/\"Contact us\") was needed to satisfy those feature constraints.\n\n---\n\n### What you get in 2024 (pricing/1)\n\nFrom the 2024 YAML and tool output:\n\n- **Required features included on FREE:**\n  - `componentsRelease` \u2014 described as **\u201c250 credits per release\u201d**\n  - `concurrentJobRuns`\n- **Usage limits on FREE (defaults):**\n  - `maxUsers`: 5\n  - `creditsLimit`: 30,000 credits/month\n  - `concurrentJobRunsLimitNonMacOs`: 30 concurrent jobs\n  - `concurrentJobRunsLimitMacOs`: 1 concurrent job\n  - `networkLimit`: 1 GB\n  - `storageLimit`: 2 GB\n\nBecause the FREE plan specifies `features: null` and `usageLimits: null`, it inherits these default features and limits. The solver\u2019s explicit feature list for FREE confirms it includes:\n\n- `concurrentJobRuns`\n- `components`\n- `componentsRelease`\n- plus other basics (Linux, Windows, macOS executors, private orbs, community support, etc.)\n\nSo for **2024**, the **FREE** plan at **`0 $`/month** already satisfies:\n- Having **components releases** (each release costs 250 credits from your 30,000\u2011credit pool), and  \n- Having **concurrent job runs** (up to 30 non\u2011Mac + 1 Mac concurrently).\n\n---\n\n### What you get in 2025 (pricing/2)\n\nIn 2025, CircleCI\u2019s pricing schema changes terminology:\n\n- `componentsRelease` (2024) is replaced by `releases` (2025).\n\nFrom the 2025 YAML and tool output:\n\n- **Required features included on FREE:**\n  - `releases` (default `true`)\n  - `concurrentJobRuns` (default `true`)\n- **Usage limits on FREE (defaults):**\n  - `maxUsers`: 5\n  - `creditsLimit`: 30,000 credits/month\n  - `concurrentJobRunsLimitNonMacOs`: 30 concurrent jobs\n  - `concurrentJobRunsLimitMacOs`: 1 concurrent job\n  - `networkLimit`: 1 GB\n  - `storageLimit`: 2 GB\n\nAgain, `FREE` has `features: null` and `usageLimits: null`, so it inherits all those defaults. The solver\u2019s feature list for the FREE subscription in 2025 explicitly includes:\n\n- `concurrentJobRuns`\n- `releases`\n- plus other core build features and community support.\n\nSo for **2025**, the **FREE** plan at **`0 $`/month** also satisfies:\n- Having **releases**, and  \n- Having **concurrent job runs** under the same concurrency caps as 2024.\n\n---\n\n### When you might *not* want FREE\n\nThe optimization only checked **feature availability**, not whether the **limits** are sufficient for your workload.\n\nYou would need to look beyond FREE (to `PERFORMANCE` or `SCALE`) if, for example:\n\n- You need **more concurrency** than:\n  - 30 non\u2011Mac concurrent jobs, or\n  - 1 Mac concurrent job\n- You need **more credits** than 30,000/month (especially since:\n  - In 2024, **each components release costs 250 credits**.)\n- You exceed **5 users**, **1 GB network**, or **2 GB storage**.\n\nBut purely to **have components/releases and concurrent job runs available**, at the **lowest possible cost**, the optimal configuration is:\n\n- **2024:** `FREE` plan, no add\u2011ons \u2014 **`0 $`/month**  \n- **2025:** `FREE` plan, no add\u2011ons \u2014 **`0 $`/month**",

            "answer": "Here\u2019s what the optimization and the pricing data together say.\n\n## Short answer\n\nFor **both 2019 and 2020**, the most cost\u2011effective configuration that satisfies:\n\n- `githubIntegration`\n- `centralizedBillingAndManagement`\n\nis:\n\n- **Base plan:** `COLLABORATOR`  \n- **Organizational add\u2011on:** an org\u2011level add\u2011on that enables centralized billing/management (the tooling returned `groupAccount`; the raw pricing YAML associates this capability with the `siteLicense` add\u2011on).  \n- **Base plan price:**  \n  - **2019:** `COLLABORATOR` = **15 USD/month**  \n  - **2020:** `COLLABORATOR` = **15 USD/month**  \n- **Add\u2011on price:** `\"Contact Sales\"` (non\u2011numeric), so total cost cannot be computed from the file.\n\nIn both years, no cheaper plan/add\u2011on combination can meet both required features based on the available pricing data.\n\n---\n\n## What the optimizer found\n\nThe optimization tool was run separately on the **2019** and **2020** pricing snapshots with filters:\n\n- `features = [\"githubIntegration\", \"centralizedBillingAndManagement\"]`\n- objective: **minimize** total subscription cost.\n\nFor **both 2019 and 2020**, the tool returned the same optimal structure:\n\n```json\n{\n  \"plan\": \"COLLABORATOR\",\n  \"addOns\": [\"groupAccount\"],\n  \"cost\": \"Subscription cost includes add-ons with non-numeric prices, cannot calculate total cost. Please check the pricing data or contact sales.\"\n}\n```\n\nThe expanded feature set for this combination in both years includes:\n\n- `githubIntegration` (from the `COLLABORATOR` plan)  \n- `centralizedBillingAndManagement` (coming via an organizational add\u2011on in the model)  \n\nBecause the add\u2011on price is `\"Contact Sales\"`, the solver could not produce a numeric total.\n\n---\n\n## Cross\u2011check against the raw pricing YAML\n\nFrom the YAML you provided:\n\n### 2019 snapshot\n\nRelevant **plans**:\n\n- `STUDENT` \u2013 8 USD/month, includes `githubIntegration`, but **cannot** be combined with the org\u2011level add\u2011ons that carry centralized billing (only `COLLABORATOR` and `PROFESSIONAL` are eligible).\n- `COLLABORATOR` \u2013 15 USD/month, includes:\n  - `githubIntegration: true`\n  - other premium features (track changes, reference tools, Dropbox, etc.)\n- `PROFESSIONAL` \u2013 30 USD/month, also includes `githubIntegration`.\n\nRelevant **add\u2011ons**:\n\n- `groupAccount` (unit: license, price: **Contact Sales**)\n  - Features: `groupLicenseManagement`, `discountedPricingForMultipleLicenses`.\n  - Available for: `COLLABORATOR`, `PROFESSIONAL`.\n- `siteLicense` (unit: site, price: **Contact Sales**)\n  - Features:\n    - `unlimitedSiteWideAccess: true`\n    - `centralizedBillingAndManagement: true`\n  - Available for: `COLLABORATOR`, `PROFESSIONAL`.\n\nFrom the YAML alone, the **only** explicit source of the feature\n`centralizedBillingAndManagement` is `siteLicense`.\n\nThus, from the raw pricing:\n\n- To get **GitHub integration**, you need at least `STUDENT` or higher.\n- To get **centralizedBillingAndManagement**, you need the **`siteLicense`** add\u2011on.\n- `siteLicense` can only be attached to `COLLABORATOR` or `PROFESSIONAL`.\n\nGiven base prices:\n\n- `COLLABORATOR` = 15 USD/month\n- `PROFESSIONAL` = 30 USD/month\n\nThe cheapest base plan that is compatible with the required org add\u2011on is **`COLLABORATOR`**, so the cost\u2011effective 2019 configuration is:\n\n> **2019:** `COLLABORATOR` (15 USD/month) + `siteLicense` add\u2011on (Contact Sales)\n\nThe optimizer\u2019s output shows `groupAccount` plus `centralizedBillingAndManagement`, which does not exactly match the YAML mapping of features to add\u2011ons. That discrepancy likely comes from how the internal model associates centralized management with the \u201cgroup\u201d offerings, but the cost conclusion is the same: you must be on **COLLABORATOR or higher**, and **COLLABORATOR is the cheaper of the two eligible tiers**.\n\n### 2020 snapshot\n\nPlans and prices in 2020:\n\n- `PERSONAL` \u2013 10 USD/month, includes `githubIntegration`, but is **not** eligible for the org add\u2011ons.\n- `STUDENT` \u2013 8 USD/month, includes `githubIntegration`, not eligible for org add\u2011ons.\n- `COLLABORATOR` \u2013 15 USD/month, includes `githubIntegration`.\n- `PROFESSIONAL` \u2013 30 USD/month, includes `githubIntegration`.\n\nOrg add\u2011ons in 2020 are essentially the same as 2019:\n\n- `groupAccount`: centralized group license management & discounts (Contact Sales).\n- `siteLicense`: `unlimitedSiteWideAccess` + `centralizedBillingAndManagement` (Contact Sales).\n- Both only available for `COLLABORATOR` and `PROFESSIONAL`.\n\nTherefore, the 2020 reasoning is identical:\n\n- Only `COLLABORATOR` and `PROFESSIONAL` can be paired with the add\u2011on that provides centralized billing/management.  \n- Among those, **`COLLABORATOR` at 15 USD/month** is the lower\u2011priced base tier.\n\nSo the 2020 cost\u2011effective configuration is:\n\n> **2020:** `COLLABORATOR` (15 USD/month) + org add\u2011on providing centralized billing (modeled as `groupAccount` by the solver; documented as `siteLicense` for `centralizedBillingAndManagement` in the YAML; price = Contact Sales)\n\n---\n\n## Why this is \u201cmost cost\u2011effective\u201d\n\n1. **GitHub integration constraint:**  \n   All of `STUDENT`, `COLLABORATOR`, and `PROFESSIONAL` include `githubIntegration` in both years. `PERSONAL` (2019=0 USD, 2020=10 USD) either lacks GitHub or is not eligible for the needed org add\u2011on.\n\n2. **Centralized billing & management constraint:**  \n   The feature `centralizedBillingAndManagement` is only supplied by an organizational add\u2011on (`siteLicense` in the YAML; the solver treats a \u201cgroup\u201d add\u2011on as satisfying the same capability). These org add\u2011ons are **only available for `COLLABORATOR` and `PROFESSIONAL`**.\n\n3. **Base plan cost comparison:**\n\n   | Year | Eligible plans | Base monthly price | Outcome |\n   |------|----------------|--------------------|---------|\n   | 2019 | COLLABORATOR, PROFESSIONAL | 15 vs 30 USD | **COLLABORATOR** cheaper |\n   | 2020 | COLLABORATOR, PROFESSIONAL | 15 vs 30 USD | **COLLABORATOR** cheaper |\n\n   Since the add\u2011on is \u201cContact Sales\u201d in all cases and must be purchased anyway, the part we can price numerically (the base subscription) is minimized by choosing **COLLABORATOR** rather than **PROFESSIONAL**.\n\n4. **Unknown add\u2011on price:**  \n   Because the add\u2011ons have non\u2011numeric `\"Contact Sales\"` pricing, the optimizer and I cannot provide an exact total. The tool explicitly reports:\n\n   > `\"Subscription cost includes add-ons with non-numeric prices, cannot calculate total cost. Please check the pricing data or contact sales.\"`\n\n   But no other cheaper plan/add\u2011on combination in the data satisfies both required features, so **COLLABORATOR + org add\u2011on** is the best available recommendation for both 2019 and 2020.\n\n---\n\n## Practical takeaway\n\n- In **both 2019 and 2020** you should plan on:\n  - **At least the COLLABORATOR tier per user** (15 USD/month list price), and  \n  - **An organizational add\u2011on (group account / site license)** to get centralized billing and administrative control.\n- To know the **actual total** for your specific seat count and organization, you\u2019ll need to request a quote from Overleaf (the YAML and the optimizer both treat the org add\u2011on price as non\u2011public).",

            "answer": "Between Zenhub and Trello, there is **no price difference** for getting priority support within your $43 budget:\n\n### Zenhub\n- **Cheapest plan with priority support:** `ENTERPRISE`\n- **Cost:** `12.5 $` per user/month  \n- **Why this plan:** In Zenhub\u2019s pricing, `prioritySupport` only appears on the **ENTERPRISE** plan.  \n- **What you get in addition to priority support (from the YAML):**  \n  - API access, burndown charts, estimates, epics  \n  - Unlimited repositories (including private), multi-repo boards  \n  - Slack integration, cloud hosting, optional on\u2011premises hosting  \n  - Access to beta program and a **dedicated customer success manager**  \n\nWith a total monthly budget of $43, you can afford up to **3 users** on Zenhub ENTERPRISE (3 \u00d7 12.5 $ = 37.5 $; 4 users would be 50 $ and exceed your budget).\n\n---\n\n### Trello\n- **Cheapest plan with priority support:** `BUSINESS_CLASS`\n- **Cost:** `12.5 $` per user/month  \n- **Why this plan:** Trello\u2019s `prioritySupport` is first included at the **BUSINESS_CLASS** level; the FREE plan does not have it, and no add\u2011on provides priority support on its own.  \n- **What you get in addition to priority support (from the YAML):**  \n  - Advanced checklists, observers, custom backgrounds & stickers  \n  - Unlimited team boards and Power\u2011Ups per board  \n  - Advanced automation with Butler (scheduled commands, HTTP requests, email notifications)  \n  - Admin and security features: advanced admin permissions, domain\u2011restricted invites, deactivating members, Google Apps sign\u2011on, simple data export  \n- There is an `ATLASSIAN_ACCESS` add\u2011on (3 $ user/month) but it\u2019s for SSO and 2FA enforcement, **not** for priority support.\n\nWith the same $43 budget, you can also afford up to **3 users** on Trello BUSINESS_CLASS (again, 3 \u00d7 12.5 $ = 37.5 $).\n\n---\n\n### Conclusion\n\n- **Most economical purely by price:** It\u2019s a **tie**.  \n  - Zenhub `ENTERPRISE`: `12.5 $`/user/month  \n  - Trello `BUSINESS_CLASS`: `12.5 $`/user/month  \n- Both meet your requirement for **priority support** and fit under a **$43 total monthly budget for up to 3 users**.\n\nSo the \u201cmore economical\u201d choice comes down not to price, but to fit:\n- If you\u2019re a **GitHub\u2011centric software team** that wants deeper development workflow features (epics, burndowns, repo integration, dedicated success manager), Zenhub ENTERPRISE is likely a better value.\n- If you want a **general-purpose kanban/task management tool** with rich automations and broad team use, Trello BUSINESS_CLASS is likely the better value at the same price.",

            "answer": "Here\u2019s what the Clockify pricing data shows for **\u201ctargets and reminders\u201d** within your stated price range.\n\n---\n\n## 1. What has \u201ctargets and reminders\u201d in Clockify?\n\nIn the pricing file, `targetsAndReminders` is:\n\n> **\u201cAutomatic emails when someone forgets to log time or tracks too much.\u201d**\n\nThis feature is **not** available on the Free or Basic plans. It **is included** in these plans:\n\n- **STANDARD** \u2013 `6.99 USD` per user/month  \n- **PRO** \u2013 `9.99 USD` per user/month  \n- **ENTERPRISE** \u2013 `14.99 USD` per user/month  \n- **CAKE_BUNDLE** \u2013 `15.99 USD` per user/month  \n\nNo add-on exists that separately enables `targetsAndReminders`; you must be on one of these plans.\n\nNote: A different feature, `idleDetectionAndReminders` (simple start/stop timer reminders), is on **all** plans by default, but that\u2019s not the \u201ctargets and reminders\u201d you asked about.\n\n---\n\n## 2. Why the automated search showed 0 matches\n\nI ran a search over the structured pricing data with these filters:\n\n- `minPrice: 50`\n- `maxPrice: 181`\n- `features: [\"targetsAndReminders\"]`\n\nThe result was:\n\n```json\n\"subscriptions\": [],\n\"cardinality\": 0\n```\n\nThis happened because:\n\n- Clockify\u2019s plan prices in the data are **per user/month**.\n- All plans that include `targetsAndReminders` are priced **well below 50 USD per user/month**:\n  - 6.99, 9.99, 14.99, 15.99 USD/user/month.\n\nSo there is **no single plan** priced between **50 and 181 USD per user/month** that includes `targetsAndReminders`\u2014hence zero matches.\n\n---\n\n## 3. Interpreting your $50\u2013$181 range\n\nIf your range **$50\u2013$181** is meant as a **total monthly budget for a team**, then:\n\n- **Yes**, there are many viable configurations: any of the four plans above will fit, as long as the number of users is chosen so that  \n  `plan price \u00d7 number of users` is between **50 and 181 USD** per month.\n\nFor example (all include `targetsAndReminders`):\n\n- **STANDARD (6.99 USD/user/month)**  \n  - Fits your range for roughly **8\u201325 users**  \n    - 8 users \u2192 6.99 \u00d7 8 \u2248 **55.92 USD**  \n    - 25 users \u2192 6.99 \u00d7 25 \u2248 **174.75 USD**\n\n- **PRO (9.99 USD/user/month)**  \n  - Fits for roughly **6\u201318 users**  \n    - 6 users \u2192 9.99 \u00d7 6 \u2248 **59.94 USD**  \n    - 18 users \u2192 9.99 \u00d7 18 \u2248 **179.82 USD**\n\n- **ENTERPRISE (14.99 USD/user/month)**  \n  - Fits for roughly **4\u201312 users**  \n    - 4 users \u2192 14.99 \u00d7 4 \u2248 **59.96 USD**  \n    - 12 users \u2192 14.99 \u00d7 12 \u2248 **179.88 USD**\n\n- **CAKE_BUNDLE (15.99 USD/user/month)**  \n  - Fits for roughly **4\u201311 users**  \n    - 4 users \u2192 15.99 \u00d7 4 \u2248 **63.96 USD**  \n    - 11 users \u2192 15.99 \u00d7 11 \u2248 **175.89 USD**\n\n---\n\n## 4. Direct answer\n\n- **If you mean \u201cper user\u201d price between $50 and $181**:  \n  \u2192 **No** such plan exists in the Clockify data, so there are **0 configurations** matching that.\n\n- **If you mean \u201ctotal monthly spend\u201d between $50 and $181**:  \n  \u2192 **Yes**. Any of these plans \u2014 **STANDARD, PRO, ENTERPRISE, or CAKE_BUNDLE** \u2014 can meet that budget for the user-count ranges above, and all of them **include `targetsAndReminders`**.\n\nIf you tell me how many users you need, I can point out exactly which plan(s) and configurations fit within $50\u2013$181.",

            "answer": "Yes, but only partially\u2014and only with the **BUSINESS** plan. Here\u2019s what we can say with certainty from the Wrike pricing data and the solver\u2019s results.\n\n---\n\n## 1. Which plans include the Adobe Creative Cloud extension?\n\nWrike has two related features in the pricing file:\n\n- `extensionForAdobeCreativeCloud`  \n- `adobeCreativeCloudExtension`  \n\nBoth are enabled on these plans:\n\n- **BUSINESS** \u2013 price: **24.8 USD per user/month**\n- **ENTERPRISE** \u2013 price: **Contact Sales**\n- **PINNACLE** \u2013 price: **Contact Sales**\n\nSo any subscription that includes the Adobe Creative Cloud extension must be one of these three plans.\n\n---\n\n## 2. Applying your price range ($88\u2013$160)\n\nWe only have numeric prices for:\n\n- **BUSINESS**: **24.8 USD user/month**, with  \n  - `minNumberOfUsers`: **5**  \n  - `maxNumberOfUsers`: **200**\n\nIf we look just at the base BUSINESS license:\n\n\\[\n\\text{Total monthly cost} = 24.8 \\times \\text{#users}\n\\]\n\nTo be between **88 and 160 USD**:\n\n- 88 \u2264 24.8 \u00d7 users \u2264 160  \n  \u21d2 users \u2248 3.5 to 6.45\n\nWrike\u2019s minimum for BUSINESS is **5 users**, so the valid, within-range configurations (ignoring add-ons) are:\n\n- **BUSINESS, 5 users** \u2192 5 \u00d7 24.8 = **124.0 USD / month**\n- **BUSINESS, 6 users** \u2192 6 \u00d7 24.8 = **148.8 USD / month**\n\nBoth:\n\n- Include **Adobe Creative Cloud extension** (built into BUSINESS).\n- Stay within your **$88\u2013$160/month** budget (for license fees).\n- Respect Wrike\u2019s published minimum user count.\n\nWe **cannot** verify price-band compliance for:\n\n- **ENTERPRISE** and **PINNACLE** (their plan prices are \u201cContact Sales\u201d).\n\n---\n\n## 3. What the tool actually found\n\nUsing your filters (feature = `adobeCreativeCloudExtension`, price between 88 and 160), the solver returned **4 configurations**, all with the **BUSINESS** plan:\n\n- Plan: **BUSINESS**\n- Add-on: always includes `additional500GBStorage`\n- In some variants, features also include `wrikeIntegrate` or `wrikeSync`\n- All of them include both:\n  - `extensionForAdobeCreativeCloud`\n  - `adobeCreativeCloudExtension`\n\nHowever, for **all four** configurations the tool reports:\n\n> \u201cSubscription cost includes add-ons with non-numeric prices, cannot calculate total cost. Please check the pricing data or contact sales.\u201d\n\nReason: in the YAML:\n\n- `additional500GBStorage` \u2013 **price: Contact Sales**  \n- `wrikeIntegrate` \u2013 **price: Contact Sales**  \n- `wrikeSync` \u2013 **price: Contact Sales**\n\nBecause these add-ons don\u2019t have numeric prices, the solver cannot compute the *true* total and therefore cannot reliably enforce the **$88\u2013$160** band on those full configurations. It likely filtered based on the base BUSINESS license cost only.\n\nSo:\n\n- We **can** say they are BUSINESS configurations with Adobe Creative Cloud integration.\n- We **cannot** confirm they stay within $88\u2013$160 once add-on pricing is included.\n\n---\n\n## 4. Practical answer to your question\n\n**Yes, it is possible to identify configurations that include the Adobe Creative Cloud extension and (based on list pricing) stay between 88 and 160 USD/month, but only for the parts with published prices.**\n\nFrom the available data, the configurations we can *confidently* recommend are:\n\n1. **BUSINESS plan, 5 users, no paid add-ons**  \n   - Price: **124.0 USD/month**  \n   - Includes Adobe Creative Cloud extension.\n\n2. **BUSINESS plan, 6 users, no paid add-ons**  \n   - Price: **148.8 USD/month**  \n   - Includes Adobe Creative Cloud extension.\n\nAny BUSINESS configuration that adds:\n\n- `additional500GBStorage`, `additional1TBStorage`, `wrikeIntegrate`, or `wrikeSync`\n\nmight still be within your range, but **we don\u2019t have numeric prices for those add-ons**, so we can\u2019t determine that from the file\u2014you\u2019d need to:\n\n- start from the base cost (5 or 6 users \u00d7 24.8 USD), and  \n- ask Wrike sales for the add-on pricing to see whether the total stays under **160 USD/month**.\n\nIf you tell me how many users you\u2019re planning for and whether you need extra storage or Wrike Integrate/Sync, I can spell out exactly which combinations are *theoretically* in range and where you\u2019d need a sales quote to confirm.",

            "answer": "According to the ClickUp pricing model you provided, there are **no configurations** whose price falls between **109 USD and 115 USD** that match the tool\u2019s criteria.\n\n### What the search actually found\n\nI ran a `subscriptions` search with:\n\n- `minPrice`: **109**\n- `maxPrice`: **115**\n- `features`: `pulseLiveOverview`\n\nThe result was:\n\n- `subscriptions: []`\n- `cardinality: 0`\n\nSo, within this pricing dataset, **no single ClickUp plan (per member/month) is priced in the 109\u2013115 USD range**, even though we required `pulseLiveOverview`.\n\n### How Pulse Live Overview fits into the plans\n\nFrom the pricing YAML:\n\n- `pulseLiveOverview` is a **core feature**:\n  - `defaultValue: true`\n  - `type: INFORMATION`\n- That means it\u2019s **on by default for all plans**, including:\n  - **FREE** \u2013 `price: 0 USD / member/month`\n  - **UNLIMITED** \u2013 `price: 9 USD / member/month`\n  - **BUSINESS** \u2013 `price: 19 USD / member/month`\n  - **ENTERPRISE** \u2013 `price: Contact Sales`\n\nThere is also a usage limit:\n\n- Global default:  \n  `pulseLiveOverviewLimit: 100 uses` (applies to FREE, since its `usageLimits` are null)\n- Paid plans (UNLIMITED, BUSINESS, ENTERPRISE) override this to `1000000000` uses, i.e. effectively unlimited.\n\nSo:\n\n- **Yes**, Pulse Live Overview is included in *every* plan in this dataset.\n- **No**, there is **no plan priced between 109 and 115 USD per member/month**\u2014the only numeric per\u2011member prices here are **0, 9, and 19 USD**.\n\n### If your 109\u2013115 USD is a *total* monthly budget\n\nThe tools you asked me to run filter on the **plan\u2019s unit price** (per member/month), not the total workspace bill (seats \u00d7 price + add\u2011ons). That\u2019s why the automated search returned zero matches.\n\nIf your 109\u2013115 USD range is meant as a **total** monthly spend for the whole workspace, you *can* manually choose combinations that land in that range, such as:\n\n- **BUSINESS plan (19 USD/member/month)**  \n  - 6 members \u2192 6 \u00d7 19 = **114 USD/month** (includes Pulse Live Overview)\n- Or 5 BUSINESS members (5 \u00d7 19 = 95 USD) plus guest add\u2011ons:\n  - Each \u201cadditional full guest for Business\u201d add\u2011on costs **9 USD/month**\n  - 5 members + 2 guest add\u2011ons \u2192 95 + (2 \u00d7 9) = **113 USD/month**\n\nThose are valid ClickUp configurations that:\n- Include **Pulse Live Overview**, and\n- Keep the **total** around 109\u2013115 USD/month, even though the underlying per\u2011member plan price is 19 USD.\n\n### Bottom line\n\n- **From the tool\u2019s perspective (per-member price):**  \n  There are **no configurations** priced between **109 and 115 USD per member/month** that include Pulse Live Overview\u2014because all standard plans are at 0, 9, or 19 USD/member/month and all already include that feature.\n- **From a total-budget perspective:**  \n  You *can* assemble configurations (e.g., 6 BUSINESS seats, or 5 BUSINESS seats + 2 guest add\u2011ons) with total monthly cost in the 109\u2013115 USD range while still having Pulse Live Overview.",

            "answer": "Based on the Shopify pricing data you provided, there is **no configuration that satisfies all three of your constraints simultaneously**:\n\n- Budget: **\u2264 28 USD / month**\n- Feature: **24/7Support** required\n- Usage limit: **shippingDiscountRate \u2265 0.80 (80%)**\n\nHere\u2019s why, using the exact values from the YAML:\n\n### 1. 24/7 Support\n\nThe feature:\n\n- `24/7Support`  \n  - Description: *\u201cGet 24/7 phone, email, and live chat support\u201d*  \n  - `defaultValue: true`\n\nBecause this is a global feature with `defaultValue: true`, it is included on **all plans** (BASIC, SHOPIFY, ADVANCED) unless overridden. So every core plan you see has 24/7 support.\n\n### 2. Shipping discount rate on each plan\n\nThe relevant usage limit:\n\n- `shippingDiscountRate`  \n  - `defaultValue: 0.77` (i.e., 77%)  \n  - Linked to the `shippingDiscount` feature (\u201cCompetitive shipping rates from DHL Express, UPS, or USPS\u201d).\n\nPlan-specific values:\n\n- **BASIC**\n  - `price: 29` USD / user / month\n  - `usageLimits: null` \u2192 uses defaults\n  - So `shippingDiscountRate = 0.77` (77%)\n\n- **SHOPIFY**\n  - `price: 79` USD / user / month\n  - `usageLimits.shippingDiscountRate.value: 0.88` (88%)\n\n- **ADVANCED**\n  - `price: 299` USD / user / month\n  - `usageLimits.shippingDiscountRate.value: 0.88` (88%)\n\nSo the only plans that meet your **\u201cat least 80% shipping discount\u201d** condition are:\n\n- **SHOPIFY** at **79 USD** with 88% shipping discount  \n- **ADVANCED** at **299 USD** with 88% shipping discount  \n\nBoth are **well above your 28 USD budget**.\n\n### 3. Budget feasibility\n\nYour budget: **28 USD**\n\nCheapest plan:\n\n- **BASIC** at **29 USD**, which:\n  - Includes 24/7Support (meets support requirement)\n  - Has `shippingDiscountRate = 0.77` (77%), which is **below** your required 0.80 (80%)\n  - And is already **over your 28 USD budget** by $1\n\nSo:\n\n- **No plan is at or below $28/month**, and  \n- The only plans with \u226580% shipping discount start at **$79/month**.\n\n### 4. Add-ons and other configurations\n\n- The only add-on in the YAML is **SHOPIFY_POS_PRO** at **89 USD**.  \n- It does not change the shipping discount rate and would be *in addition* to a base plan (so it only raises the total price).\n\nTherefore, there is **no combination of base plan + add-ons** that:\n1. Costs \u2264 28 USD/month, **and**\n2. Provides 24/7Support, **and**\n3. Has `shippingDiscountRate \u2265 0.80`.\n\n### 5. What the optimization tool error means\n\nThe optimization tool failed with:\n\n> `cannot determine coercion from type array[int] of float to type array[int] of int`\n\nThat\u2019s a type-mismatch issue inside the solver, not a pricing problem. I bypassed the tool and read the Shopify YAML directly to derive the plan prices and shipping discount rates above.\n\n---\n\n**Conclusion:**  \nGiven the Shopify pricing and usage limits in your YAML, **there is no valid Shopify configuration that meets all your requirements without exceeding your $28/month budget**. To get at least an 80% shipping discount rate with 24/7 support, you would need to raise your budget to at least **79 USD/month** for the **SHOPIFY** plan.",

            "answer": "Here\u2019s the configuration that best meets your requirements without exceeding your $175 budget:\n\n---\n\n## Recommended configuration\n\n**Plan:** `CREATOR`  \n**Add\u2011on:** Tableau Data Management for Creator (in the YAML: `dataManagementCreator`)  \n**Total cost:** **75.5 $** per user/month  \n\nThis is comfortably under your 175 $ budget per month, leaving room for additional users if needed.\n\n---\n\n## Why this is the best (and effectively only) fit\n\n### 1. Ability to create and publish new data sources\n\nYour requirement:  \n> \u201cneeds create and publish new data sources\u201d\n\nIn the pricing file, that maps directly to the feature:\n\n- `createAndPublishNewDataSources`\n\nFrom the YAML:\n\n- The **`CREATOR`** plan is the only plan that includes  \n  `createAndPublishNewDataSources: true`.\n\nNeither `VIEWER` nor `EXPLORER` includes this capability, and no add\u2011on upgrades them to do so. So:\n\n- Any valid configuration **must** be based on the **CREATOR** plan.\n\n---\n\n### 2. At least 1 flow in usage limits\n\nYour requirement:  \n> \u201cwith at least a usage limit of 1 flow\u201d\n\nIn the YAML, this is modeled as:\n\n- `usageLimits.flowsLimit` \u2014  \n  *\u201cThe maximum number of flows that can be created and run by a user.\u201d*  \n  Default is 0 (no flows).\n\nBase `CREATOR` has `usageLimits: null`, so flowsLimit defaults to 0.  \nTo get flowsLimit \u2265 1, there are two relevant add\u2011ons:\n\n1. **Data Management for Creator (`dataManagementCreator`)**\n   - Price: 5.5 $\n   - Features it adds:\n     - `publishFlows: true`\n     - `runFlows: true`\n     - `scheduleFlows: true`\n     - `monitorFlowPerformance: true`\n     - `monitorFlowHealth: true`\n     - `viewLineageAndImpact: true`\n     - `setDataQualityWarnings: true`\n   - Usage limits:\n     - `flowsLimit: 1`\n\n2. **`resourceBlocks`** (also only for `CREATOR`)\n   - Price: 250 $ per block/month\n   - Only adds a `flowsLimit` extension of 1, and would put the total well **over** your 175 $ budget when combined with CREATOR.\n\nThus:\n\n- **`CREATOR` + Data Management for Creator** gives you  \n  `flowsLimit: 1` at **75.5 $** total per user/month.\n- **`CREATOR` + resourceBlocks** would cost **320 $** (70 + 250), which violates your budget.\n\nSo the cheapest way to achieve **flowsLimit \u2265 1** and stay under 175 $ is:\n\n> **`CREATOR` plan + Data Management for Creator add\u2011on = 75.5 $**\n\n---\n\n## Budget context\n\n- One **CREATOR + Data Management** user: **75.5 $**  \n- With a **175 $** budget, you could afford up to:\n  - **2 such users** (2 \u00d7 75.5 $ = 151 $) and still stay within budget.\n\nIf you tell me how many users need these capabilities, I can spell out the exact total and configuration per user.",

To fit 35 users into 93 USD, the per\u2011user price would need to be \u2264 2.66 USD, far below all published Box business prices (15+ USD user/month).

            "answer": "From the uploaded Jira pricing data, there is **no calculable numeric maximum** cost for a single subscription.\n\n### What the optimization found\n\nRunning the \u201cmaximize cost\u201d optimization over the pricing YAML produced this configuration:\n\n- **Plan:** `ENTERPRISE`  \n- **Add-ons:** `atlassianAccessAddOn`  \n- **Reported cost field from the tool:**  \n  > \"Subscription cost includes non-numeric plan price, cannot calculate total cost. Please check the pricing data or contact sales.\"\n\nThis happens because in the YAML:\n\n- `plans.ENTERPRISE.price` is set to **`Contact Sales`** (non\u2011numeric).\n- `addOns.atlassianAccessAddOn.price` is also **`Contact Sales`**.\n- `addOns.extraEnterpriseUser.price` is likewise **`Contact Sales`**.\n\nSo while the optimizer correctly identifies that the **ENTERPRISE** tier plus **Atlassian Access** add-on is the \u201chighest\u201d tier (and supports up to **35,000 users** and **150 sites**, with effectively unlimited automation and storage), the actual **per\u2011user price is not given as a number**. Because of that, the tool cannot compute or bound the maximum dollar amount for a single subscription.\n\n### What *can* be computed from the numeric prices\n\nIf you ignore all plans/add-ons where the price is `Contact Sales` and only use numeric prices:\n\n- The most expensive numerically priced plan is:\n  - **`PREMIUM`** at **16 USD per user/month**, with a **usersLimit of 35,000**.\n- Under that constraint, a single PREMIUM subscription could reach:\n  - **16 USD \u00d7 35,000 users = 560,000 USD per month**  \n    (excluding any discounts, taxes, or custom enterprise pricing).\n\nHowever, because ENTERPRISE and key add-ons are custom-priced, the **true maximum** that Jira could charge for a single Enterprise subscription is **not derivable** from this pricing file and ultimately depends on Atlassian\u2019s negotiated quote.",

Please check the pricing data or contact sales.\"**\n   - This happens because the Enterprise plan\u2019s price is not a number in the data.\n\n2. **Enterprise pricing is non-numeric and unbounded in size**\n   - In the YAML, the Enterprise plan is defined as:\n     ```yaml\n     ENTERPRISE:\n       price: Contact Sales\n       unit: user/month\n       usageLimits:\n         usersLimit:\n           value: .inf\n         users:\n           value: 3\n     ```\n   - The Enterprise add\u2011on is also:\n     ```yaml\n     extraEnterpriseUser:\n       price: Contact Sales\n       unit: user/month\n       usageLimitsExtensions:\n         users:\n           value: 1\n       availableFor:\n         - ENTERPRISE\n     ```\n   - Two implications:\n     - **Price per user is \u201cContact Sales\u201d**, i.e., not a fixed numeric amount in the file.\n     - **`usersLimit: .inf`** means there is effectively no encoded upper bound on how many users you can attach to a single Enterprise subscription.\n   - Because both the base Enterprise price and extraEnterpriseUser add\u2011on price are unspecified (non-numeric) and you can, in principle, add arbitrarily many users, the model does not define a numeric maximum revenue per Enterprise subscription.\n\n3. **Even among numeric plans, the maximum is still unbounded**\n   Ignoring Enterprise completely and looking only at numeric prices:\n\n   - **STANDARD**:\n     ```yaml\n     STANDARD:\n       price: 45\n       unit: 3 user/month\n       usageLimits:\n         usersLimit:\n           value: .inf\n         users:\n           value: 3\n     addOns:\n       extraStandardUser:\n         price: 15\n         unit: user/month\n         usageLimitsExtensions:\n           users:\n             value: 1\n     ```\n     Cost formula per month:  \n     `45 + 15 \u00d7 (number of extraStandardUser add\u2011ons)`  \n     With `usersLimit: .inf`, you can add arbitrarily many users \u21d2 cost has **no upper bound**.\n\n   - **ADVANCED**:\n     ```yaml\n     ADVANCED:\n       price: 72\n       unit: 3 user/month\n       usageLimits:\n         usersLimit:\n           value: .inf\n         users:\n           value: 3\n     addOns:\n       extraAdvancedUser:\n         price: 24\n         unit: user/month\n         usageLimitsExtensions:\n           users:\n             value: 1\n     ```\n     Cost formula per month:  \n     `72 + 24 \u00d7 (number of extraAdvancedUser add\u2011ons)`  \n     Again, `usersLimit: .inf` \u21d2 no encoded maximum.\n\n   So even in the purely numeric part of the model (Standard and Advanced), the subscription cost can increase without bound as you add more users.\n\n---\n\n**Answer:**  \nFrom this pricing data, there is **no defined maximum** cost for a single Dropbox subscription. The Enterprise plan and its add\u2011ons use non-numeric \u201cContact Sales\u201d pricing and allow an unlimited number of users, and even the numeric business plans (Standard and Advanced) allow unlimited paid users via add\u2011ons. As a result, the maximum possible monthly revenue from one subscription is **theoretically unbounded** in this model and cannot be expressed as a specific dollar amount.",

Please check the pricing data or contact sales.\"`\n\n  Therefore, **the maximum cost that Notion can generate from a single subscription cannot be determined from this data and is effectively unbounded; it depends entirely on the negotiated Enterprise and add-on rates and your chosen user/domain counts.**",

            "answer": "From the pricing data and the optimizer\u2019s result, there is **no numeric upper bound** we can reliably give for the maximum cost of a single Box subscription.\n\n### Why no numeric maximum can be computed\n\n1. **The optimizer\u2019s result**\n\n   The maximization run returned this as the \u201cbest\u201d subscription:\n\n   - **Plan:** `ENTERPRISE_PLUS`  \n   - **Add-ons:** multiple instances of `boxGovernance`  \n   - **Reported cost:**  \n     > `\"Subscription cost includes non-numeric plan price, cannot calculate total cost. Please check the pricing data or contact sales.\"`\n\n   That message is the exact `cost` field from the tool, meaning: as soon as a **non-numeric price** appears anywhere in the configuration, the total cost cannot be calculated.\n\n2. **Non-numeric (\u201cContact Sales\u201d) prices in the YAML**\n\n   In the Pricing2Yaml, several key items are priced as **\u201cContact Sales\u201d** rather than a number:\n\n   - **Plan `ENTERPRISE_PLUS`:**\n     ```yaml\n     ENTERPRISE_PLUS:\n       price: Contact Sales\n       unit: user/month\n     ```\n   - Add-ons:\n     - `boxGovernance` \u2013 \u201cUse Box Governance to implement data retention rules\u2026\u201d\n     - `boxKeySafe` \u2013 customer-managed encryption keys\n     - `boxZones` \u2013 regional data residency\n     - `boxShield` \u2013 advanced security controls\n     - `extraUserEnterprisePlus` \u2013 extra users for `ENTERPRISE_PLUS`\n     \n     All of these have:\n     ```yaml\n     price: Contact Sales\n     ```\n\n   Since the optimizer selected `ENTERPRISE_PLUS` plus `boxGovernance` add-ons as the revenue-maximizing combination, and **all of those have non-numeric prices**, the tool correctly reported that it **cannot compute a numeric total cost**.\n\n3. **Effect on \u201cmaximum cost\u201d**\n\n   Because:\n   - the top-tier plan (`ENTERPRISE_PLUS`) is priced as **Contact Sales**, and  \n   - its key scalability drivers (governance/security add-ons and extra users) are also **Contact Sales**,  \n\n   there is **no concrete numeric maximum** you can derive from this pricing file. The actual maximum revenue from a single very large enterprise subscription is determined by **custom negotiation with Box Sales**, not by fixed list prices.\n\n### What we *can* say with list prices only (for context)\n\nIf you temporarily **ignore all \u201cContact Sales\u201d plans and add-ons** and look only at publicly listed numeric prices:\n\n- The most expensive fully list-priced configuration is:\n  - **Plan:** `ENTERPRISE` \u2013 `105 EUR` per `3 users/month` (i.e., `35 EUR` per user/month)\n  - **Add-on:** `extraUserEnterprise` \u2013 `35 EUR` per additional user/month\n  - Plan usage limits set `maxUsers` to `.inf`, which the optimizer normalizes to `100000000` users.\n\n  Under that interpretation, up to **100,000,000 users** could be on one ENTERPRISE subscription, all at `35 EUR` per user/month, yielding:\n\n  \\[\n  100{,}000{,}000 \\text{ users} \\times 35 \\text{ EUR/user/month} = 3{,}500{,}000{,}000 \\text{ EUR/month}\n  \\]\n\n  So **3.5 billion EUR/month** is the highest *fully list-priced* subscription cost implied by the structured data, assuming the solver\u2019s `100000000`-user cap for `.inf`.\n\nBut once you reintroduce `ENTERPRISE_PLUS` and its \u201cContact Sales\u201d add-ons, **the true maximum cost becomes dependent on confidential, negotiated pricing**. Therefore:\n\n> **Final answer:** Based on the provided pricing data, the maximum cost that Box can generate from a single subscription **cannot be expressed as a numeric value**, because the revenue-maximizing configuration uses the `ENTERPRISE_PLUS` plan and \u201cContact Sales\u201d\u2013priced add-ons whose prices are not specified.",

Only consider upgrading if you also need SSO, private plugins, branching/merging, or stronger admin/security controls across a larger team.\n\nIf you tell me how many editors you have and whether you need SSO, private plugins, or strict security controls, I can say more concretely whether Organization or Enterprise would be a good use of that larger budget.",

            "answer": "Yes, you should switch off the Starter plan if you truly need 50,000 API calls per month.\n\nHere\u2019s why, based on the Box pricing data you provided:\n\n1. What your current STARTER plan gives you\n- Plan: `STARTER`\n- Price: 15 USD for 3 users/month  \n- API limit: falls back to the default `apiCallsLimit` of **25,000 calls/month** (because the plan does not override it in the YAML).\n- Other limits:  \n  - ~100 GB storage by default  \n  - 2 GB upload size limit  \n  - 3 users included, up to 10 by default\n\nSo on Starter, you only get about **25k API calls/month**. There is no add\u2011on in the pricing data that increases the API quota, so you cannot reach 50k/month while staying on Starter.\n\n2. Plans that support 50,000 API calls/month within your new budget\n\nI ran an optimization to find all Box subscriptions that:\n\n- Cost \u2264 150 USD/month\n- Include at least **50,000 API calls/month**\n\nThe solver returned 5 valid subscriptions. The ones with a clear numeric total cost are:\n\n- `BUSINESS` (no add\u2011ons) \u2013 **45 $**\n- `BUSINESS` + `boxGovernance` \u2013 **60 $**\n- `BUSINESS_PLUS` (no add\u2011ons) \u2013 **75 $**\n- `BUSINESS_PLUS` + `boxGovernance` \u2013 **100 $**\n\nOne additional `BUSINESS` configuration includes an add\u2011on with a non\u2011numeric (\u201cContact Sales\u201d) price, so the tool could not compute a total cost.\n\nAmong all of these, the **cheapest option that meets 50k API calls/month** is:\n\n> **Plan:** `BUSINESS`  \n> **Cost:** **45 $** for 3 users/month  \n> **API limit:** 50,000 calls/month\n\n3. What upgrading from STARTER \u2192 BUSINESS gets you\n\nCompared to Starter, the `BUSINESS` plan (45 $) gives you:\n\n- **API quota:** increased from ~25,000 \u2192 **50,000 calls/month**\n- **Storage:** secure storage limit set to **Infinity**\n- **Larger file uploads:** 5 GB upload size limit  \n- **Enterprise/security features** turned on by default:\n  - `advancedSecurityReporting`\n  - `advancedUserReporting`\n  - `activeDirectoryIntegration` (connect to AD)\n  - `singleSignOn` (SSO via an identity provider)\n  - `customBranding`\n  - `mobileSecurityControls`\n  - `emmIntegrations`\n  - `dataLossPrevention`\n\nYou stay well under your new budget of 150 USD/month, and you get a lot more than just the higher API quota.\n\n4. When would BUSINESS_PLUS make sense?\n\n`BUSINESS_PLUS` at 75 $ also gives 50,000 API calls/month, and adds features like:\n\n- `unlimitedExternalCollaborators`\n- `completeContentVisibility` and `completeContentManagement`\n- `userActivityTracking`\n- `adminRoleDelegation`\n- `customMetadata`, `customTemplates`, `customTermsOfService`\n- `pciDssCompliance`\n\nThat might be \u201cworth it\u201d if you specifically need those advanced collaboration/compliance and metadata features. But purely for hitting 50k API calls with your new budget, you\u2019d be paying **30 $ more per month** than you need to.\n\n5. Direct recommendation\n\n- If your main new requirement is **50,000 API calls/month** and your budget is now up to **150 USD**:\n  - **Yes, it\u2019s worth (and effectively necessary) to switch off Starter.**\n  - The most cost\u2011effective choice that satisfies this is the **`BUSINESS` plan at 45 $**.\n- Consider `BUSINESS_PLUS` only if you have clear needs for the extra governance/collaboration/compliance features.\n\nIf you tell me how many users you actually have and whether you need things like SSO, external collaborators, or compliance (PCI/HIPAA, etc.), I can refine whether `BUSINESS` or `BUSINESS_PLUS` is the better fit for you.",

That\u2019s because Enterprise is priced as **\u201cContact Sales\u201d**, so it doesn\u2019t have a fixed numeric price the solver can use; it\u2019s effectively outside the \u201c\u2264 $60\u201d range from the tool\u2019s point of view.\n\n### So, is it \u201cworth\u201d switching from Personal?\n\nIt depends on what you really mean by \u201cneed a manager for dedicated customer support\u201d:\n\n1. **If you literally need a dedicated customer manager (a named account/CSM):**\n   - The **only** Notion plan that includes `dedicatedCustomerManager` is **Enterprise**.\n   - Enterprise has **no public price**; you must talk to Sales, and in practice it\u2019s aimed at larger organizations with many seats and higher budgets.\n   - Given your budget of **$60**, it is **unlikely** (though not impossible) that an Enterprise contract will fit, especially if you\u2019re just a single user or a very small team.\n   - Conclusion:  \n     - With a hard budget of **$60**, there is **no guaranteed Notion plan** that meets the \u201cdedicated manager\u201d requirement.  \n     - To pursue this, you\u2019d have to contact Notion Sales and see if there\u2019s any small-scale Enterprise arrangement, but that would be atypical.\n\n2. **If what you really need is *better / faster support*, not necessarily a named manager:**\n   - Both **Personal Pro (5 USD/user/month)** and **Team (10 USD/user/month)** include:\n     - `prioritySupport: true`\n   - With **$60/month**, you have room for:\n     - Up to **12 Personal Pro seats**, or  \n     - Up to **6 Team seats**.\n   - In that case, **yes, it\u2019s likely worth upgrading** from Personal:\n     - You gain priority support (faster responses from Notion\u2019s support team).\n     - You also get useful product features (version history, unlimited uploads, more collaboration tools, etc.).\n\n### Practical recommendation\n\n- If you are **solo or very small (1\u20132 people)** and want better support and more capability:\n  - Upgrade to **Personal Pro** at **5 USD / user/month**.\n- If you\u2019re running a **small team that actively collaborates in Notion**:\n  - Consider **Team** at **10 USD / user/month** per member, staying within your 60 USD budget cap.\n\n- If a **truly dedicated customer manager is non\u2011negotiable**:\n  - You would need **Enterprise**, which:\n    - Is the *only* plan with `dedicatedCustomerManager: true`.\n    - Has \u201cContact Sales\u201d pricing, so you cannot be sure it fits within 60 USD.\n  - Realistically, at a 60 USD budget, you should expect **priority support** but **not** a dedicated manager on Notion\u2019s standard plans.\n\nIf you tell me how many users you have and whether collaboration features matter to you, I can recommend a very specific configuration (e.g., exact plan and seat count) that stays under $60 and maximizes what you get.",

            "answer": "You\u2019ll have to move off the **Free** plan if you want to send **transactional emails via Mailchimp**. The cheapest Mailchimp Marketing configuration that supports that is:\n\n- **Plan:** `STANDARD`  \n- **Base price:** **20 USD / month** for up to 500 contacts (unit: \u201c500 users/month\u201d)  \n- **Required add\u2011on:** `transactionalEmailsAddOn` (provides the `transactionalEmails` feature)  \n- **Add\u2011on price:** listed as **\u201cContact Sales\u201d** (non\u2011numeric, so the exact total can\u2019t be calculated from the data)\n\n### Why the Free plan won\u2019t work\n\nFrom the pricing data:\n\n- The `transactionalEmails` feature is **not** included in any core plan by default (its `defaultValue` is `false`).\n- It is only provided by the **`transactionalEmailsAddOn`**, which is **available for**:\n  - `STANDARD`\n  - `PREMIUM`\n- The **FREE** and **ESSENTIALS** plans cannot attach this add\u2011on, so they can\u2019t send transactional emails through Mailchimp\u2019s transactional service at all.\n\nSo, staying on **FREE** is not an option if \u201cability to send transactional emails from Mailchimp\u201d is a hard requirement.\n\n### Why the optimal plan is STANDARD (and not something else)\n\nI ran an optimization with these constraints:\n\n- Must include the `transactionalEmails` feature  \n- Budget cap: **175 USD / month**  \n- Objective: minimize subscription cost\n\nGiven the pricing file:\n\n- **`PREMIUM`** base price is **350 USD / month** \u2192 already **above** your 175 USD budget before add\u2011ons.  \n- **`STANDARD`** base price is **20 USD / month** \u2192 **within** budget and is one of the only plans allowed to use `transactionalEmailsAddOn`.\n\nThe tool therefore selected **`STANDARD`** as the optimal base plan.  \nHowever, because the add\u2011on\u2019s price is \u201cContact Sales\u201d (non\u2011numeric), the solver returned:\n\n> \u201cSubscription cost includes add-ons with non-numeric prices, cannot calculate total cost. Please check the pricing data or contact sales.\u201d\n\nSo we know **which plan+add\u2011on combination you need**, but not the **exact final monthly cost**.\n\n### What you gain by switching from FREE \u2192 STANDARD\n\nBeyond unlocking transactional emails (via the add\u2011on), `STANDARD` materially upgrades your marketing capabilities versus `FREE`:\n\n- **Contact & send limits**  \n  - FREE defaults:\n    - `contactsLimit`: **500**\n    - `monthlyEmailSends`: **2,500** emails/month  \n  - STANDARD (from tool result & pricing file):\n    - `contactsLimit`: **100,000**\n    - `monthlyEmailSends`: **1,200,000** emails/month  \n\n- **Advanced marketing features** (all included in STANDARD, not in FREE), e.g.:\n  - Advanced segmentation, predicted demographics, CLV and purchase\u2011likelihood scores\n  - Prebuilt & custom\u2011coded templates, removal of Mailchimp footer\n  - Multi\u2011step automations and full **Customer Journey Builder** with multiple & branching starting points\n  - A/B and multivariate testing, comparative & custom reports, anomaly detection\n  - Content optimizer, dynamic content, send\u2011time optimization, delivery by time zone\n\n- **Support & onboarding upgrades**\n  - FREE: email support only for 30 days  \n  - STANDARD: **24/7 email support**, **live chat support**, **personalized onboarding** (with a usage limit of 1 onboarding session)\n\nGiven your budget jump from 0 \u2192 **175 USD/month**, these improvements plus access to transactional email are substantial.\n\n### Is it \u201cworth it\u201d for you?\n\nWithin **Mailchimp Marketing itself**:\n\n- To send transactional emails from Mailchimp, you **must**:\n  - Upgrade at least to **`STANDARD` (20 USD / month)**, **and**\n  - Add **`transactionalEmailsAddOn`** (price via Sales)\n- `PREMIUM` is strictly more expensive (350 USD base), and `FREE`/`ESSENTIALS` cannot meet your transactional requirement at all.\n\nSo:\n\n- **If you specifically want Mailchimp to handle your transactional emails**, then **yes, upgrading from FREE to STANDARD and adding the transactional emails add\u2011on is effectively required and is the lowest\u2011cost Mailchimp option that can meet your needs.**\n- Your stated budget (175 USD/month) easily covers the **base** STANDARD subscription; whether the **add\u2011on** also fits depends on the quote you get from Mailchimp Sales, since their pricing is opaque in the data (\u201cContact Sales\u201d).\n\n### Practical next steps\n\n1. **Contact Mailchimp Sales** and ask for pricing for the **`transactionalEmailsAddOn`** on the **`STANDARD`** plan at your expected transactional volume.\n2. Confirm that **STANDARD (20 USD)** + the quoted add\u2011on cost stays under **175 USD/month**.\n3. If the quote is higher than you like, consider:\n   - Keeping **Mailchimp FREE or STANDARD for marketing**, and  \n   - Using a separate provider (e.g., SendGrid, Mailgun, etc.) just for transactional emails.\n\nBut strictly within Mailchimp Marketing, **moving off the Free plan\u2014to at least STANDARD + transactionalEmailsAddOn\u2014is necessary and, given your new budget, very likely \u201cworth it\u201d if transactional email is a must\u2011have.**",

            "answer": "Based on Trello\u2019s pricing and features, you **can downgrade from Enterprise and still meet your requirement**, and you\u2019ll save money\u2014**as long as you don\u2019t rely on Enterprise\u2011only admin/security features.**\n\n### 1. Your key requirement: deactivating ex\u2011employees without losing their data\n\nYou said you need to:\n\n> \u201cdeactivate employees who leave the company without deleting their data\u201d\n\nIn Trello\u2019s feature list this is exactly:\n\n> **`deactivateMembers`** \u2013 \u201cEmployees who leave the company can have their account deactivated in your team, **without removing their work or history**.\u201d\n\nBoth **BUSINESS_CLASS** and **ENTERPRISE** include `deactivateMembers = true`.\n\nSo you do **not** need Enterprise specifically for this capability.\n\n---\n\n### 2. What the optimization found\n\nI ran an optimization over the Trello plans with these constraints:\n\n- Maximum price: **22** (per user/month)\n- Required feature: **`deactivateMembers`**\n- Objective: **minimize cost**\n\nResult:\n\n- **Cheapest qualifying plan:** `BUSINESS_CLASS`\n- **Cost:** **`12.5 $`** per user/month\n- Includes `deactivateMembers` (and many other advanced features)\n\nYour current plan:\n\n- **`ENTERPRISE`** at **20.83 $** per user/month.\n\nSo strictly against your requirements (budget \u2264 22 and needing deactivation), **BUSINESS_CLASS is the optimal plan**: it gives you the needed feature for **8.33 $ less per user/month**.\n\n---\n\n### 3. What you lose if you switch from ENTERPRISE to BUSINESS_CLASS\n\nBoth plans have rich features (priority support, advanced admin permissions, data export, Butler automation, etc.), but **Enterprise adds extra enterprise\u2011grade controls**:\n\nEnterprise has **everything in Business Class**, plus:\n\n- **Single Sign-On (`singleSignOn`)**  \n  Integrates Trello login with identity providers like Microsoft Azure AD, Okta, OneLogin, and G Suite.\n\n- **Stronger admin/governance controls**\n  - `powerUpAdministration` \u2013 control which third\u2011party Power\u2011Ups and attachment types are allowed.\n  - `attachmentRestrictions` \u2013 restrict which attachment types are allowed.\n  - `organizationWidePermissions` \u2013 set permissions at company level that cascade to all teams.\n  - `organizationVisibleBoards` \u2013 control org\u2011wide visibility of boards.\n  - `publicBoardManagement` \u2013 admins can see and change visibility of all public boards across the company.\n  - `personalizedOnboarding` \u2013 onboarding support specific to your organization.\n\n- **Automation (Butler) limits**\n  - **BUSINESS_CLASS**:  \n    - `butlerCommandsRunTeamLimit`: 1000 runs/team  \n    - `butlerCommandsRunUserLimit`: 200 runs/user  \n    - `maxCommandsRunTeamQuota`: 6000 runs/month\n  - **ENTERPRISE**: those Butler run limits are effectively **unlimited (`.inf`)**.\n\nIf you rely heavily on any of the above (SSO, central control of Power\u2011Ups/attachments, org\u2011wide permissions/visibility, or very high Butler volumes), **downgrading would be a real functional loss**.\n\n---\n\n### 4. So, is it \u201cworth\u201d switching?\n\nGiven your stated situation:\n\n- **Budget:** went from **20.83 $** to **22 $** per user/month  \n  \u2192 You **can afford to stay on Enterprise**; you\u2019re not being pushed off it by budget.\n- **Non\u2011negotiable requirement:** deactivating ex\u2011employees while keeping their data  \n  \u2192 Satisfied by both `BUSINESS_CLASS` and `ENTERPRISE`.\n- **Optimization result:**  \n  \u2192 `BUSINESS_CLASS` at **12.5 $** is the **cheapest** plan that supports `deactivateMembers`.\n\n**Conclusion:**\n\n- If your only concrete need beyond basic Trello is the ability to **deactivate members without losing their work**, and you **don\u2019t rely on**:\n  - SSO with an identity provider,\n  - central control of Power\u2011Ups/attachments,\n  - organization\u2011wide permissions/board visibility,\n  - or **unlimited** Butler automation runs,\n\n  \u2192 **Yes, it\u2019s worth switching** to **BUSINESS_CLASS**:  \n  You keep the needed deactivation feature and save **8.33 $ per user/month**.\n\n- If you **do** depend on any of those Enterprise\u2011only capabilities (especially SSO or strict governance/compliance controls), then:\n\n  \u2192 **No, it\u2019s not worth switching** purely to save money, since your budget (22 $) already accommodates the **20.83 $** Enterprise price, and downgrading would remove those controls.\n\n---\n\nIf you tell me which of these Enterprise\u2011only features (SSO, power\u2011up/attachment restrictions, org\u2011wide permissions, Butler volume, etc.) you actually use, I can give a clear \u201cswitch\u201d or \u201cstay\u201d recommendation tailored to your environment.",

            "answer": "The most worthwhile configuration for you is the **Evernote PREMIUM plan with no add\u2011ons**.\n\nHere\u2019s why, based on the pricing model and your constraints:\n\n1. **Your requirement: note size > 25 MB**\n   - The default (and thus the BASIC plan\u2019s) maximum note size is **25 MB/note**, which does **not** meet your \u201chigher than 25 MB\u201d requirement.\n   - Both **PREMIUM** and **BUSINESS** explicitly raise `maximumNoteSize` to **200 MB/note**, so they satisfy your requirement.\n\n2. **Your budget: 174 $**\n   - PREMIUM costs **7.99 $** per month.\n   - BUSINESS costs **14.99** per user/month.\n   - The optimization tool was asked to find the **cheapest** configuration under **174 $** that gives `maximumNoteSize \u2265 26 MB`. It returned:\n     - `plan`: **\"PREMIUM\"**\n     - `cost`: **\"7.99 $\"**\n     - `addOns`: `[]` (no add\u2011ons)\n   - PREMIUM is therefore the **lowest\u2011cost plan** that meets your note-size requirement and stays within your 174 $ budget.  \n     Even if your 174 $ budget is for a full year, PREMIUM is about **7.99 $ \u00d7 12 = 95.88 $/year**, well under 174 $, whereas BUSINESS would be about **14.99 \u00d7 12 = 179.88 $/year per user**, slightly above that budget.\n\n3. **What you get with PREMIUM (relevant highlights)**\n   - `maximumNoteSize`: **200 MB/note** (well above your >25 MB requirement).\n   - `globalMonthlyUploadLimit`: **10240 MB** (about 10 GB/month).\n   - `syncDevicesLimit`: **1000000` devices** (effectively unlimited devices).\n   - Advanced features over BASIC, such as:\n     - PDF and Office document search (`searchTextInsidePdfs`, `searchTextInsideOfficeDocs`)\n     - PDF annotation (`annotatePdfs`)\n     - Email forwarding into Evernote (`forwardEmailsIntoEvernote`)\n     - Version history and restore (`versionHistoryOfNotes`, `restoreNotesFromOlderVersions`)\n     - Priority support (`emailSupport`, `chatSupport`)\n\n4. **When BUSINESS would be worth considering**\n   - BUSINESS offers the same **200 MB/note** limit but adds team features like:\n     - `sharedSpaces`, `centralizedAccountAdministration`, `userManagement`, `singleSignOn`, `activityHistory`, `businessDataOwnership`\n     - Higher monthly upload limit (**20480 MB** total, with `monthlyUploadLimitByUser: 2048 MB`)\n   - These only make sense if you specifically need organization\u2011wide collaboration and admin controls; for an individual user focused on note size and staying under 174 $, BUSINESS is not as cost\u2011effective as PREMIUM.\n\nSummary:  \nGiven your budget of 174 $ and your need for more than 25 MB per note, the **Evernote PREMIUM plan (7.99 $/month, no add\u2011ons)** is the most worthwhile configuration.",

All paid plans (ESSENTIALS, TEAM, AGENCY) raise this to **2,000 ideas**, whereas the FREE plan stays at **100** and therefore does **not** meet your \u201c>100 ideas\u201d requirement.\n\n---\n\n### How this compares to other configurations\n\nWithin your **$43** budget and \u201c>100 ideas\u201d requirement:\n\n- **FREE**  \n  - ideasLimit: 100 \u2192 **does not meet your requirement**.\n\n- **ESSENTIALS** (no add-ons)  \n  - Price: **6 $/month**  \n  - ideasLimit: **2,000**  \n  - Targeted \u201cfor professionals who use publishing, analytics & engagement tools.\u201d\n  - No team\u2011collaboration features like unlimited users, approvals, or advanced team reporting.\n\n- **TEAM** (as chosen by the tool)  \n  - Price in the chosen configuration: **22 $/month**  \n  - ideasLimit: **2,000**  \n  - Adds:\n    - **additionalUsers** (unlimited team members)\n    - **draftPostManagement**, **customAccessAndPermissions**, **approvalWorkflow**\n    - Extra reporting options (e.g., **brandedReports**, **coverPage**) on top of all ESSENTIALS analytics.\n  - Includes an add\u2011on that increases **socialChannelsLimit** to **2**.\n\n- **AGENCY**  \n  - Listed price: **120 $/month**  \n  - Over your **$43** budget, so not an option.\n\n---\n\n### Which is \u201cmore worthwhile\u201d for you?\n\nBased strictly on what you specified:\n\n- **If you want the most capability and collaboration within your budget:**  \n  - The configuration found by the optimizer \u2014 **TEAM plan + extra channel at 22 $/month** \u2014 is the most worthwhile.  \n  - It gives you:\n    - 2,000 ideas (far above your >100 requirement),\n    - 2 social channels,\n    - Unlimited users and robust team workflows and reporting,\n    - All while staying well under your $43 budget.\n\n- **If you only care about meeting the ideas limit as cheaply as possible and don\u2019t need team features:**  \n  - A basic **ESSENTIALS** plan at **6 $/month** is the most economical choice.  \n  - It also gives you **2,000 ideas**, but without the team\u2011collaboration and advanced reporting extras.\n\nSo:\n\n- **Best value for features (within $43):** `TEAM` plan (with the extra channel, total **22 $/month**).  \n- **Best value for lowest cost while still meeting \u201c>100 ideas\u201d:** `ESSENTIALS` plan (**6 $/month**).",

With your 142 $ budget you can have up to **71 PRO users** at **1.99 $ per user/month**, and this configuration gives you a voice call usage limit far above your requirement of more than 1 user in the same call.",

Based on the 2020\u201111\u201130 and 2021\u201110\u201125 pricing snapshots, Clockify introduced configuration (plan and feature\u2011bundling) changes that clearly help users with a lower budget.\n\n### 1. New, cheaper paid tiers in 2021\n\n**2020 plan lineup (paid tiers):**\n\n- **PLUS** \u2013 **9.99 USD** per user/month  \n- **PREMIUM** \u2013 **29.99 USD** per user/month  \n- **ENTERPRISE** \u2013 **9.99 USD** per user/month (top\u2011feature bundle at the same listed price as PLUS)\n\nThe **cheapest paid option** for getting \u201cmanagement\u201d or \u201ccontrol\u201d features in 2020 was effectively **9.99 USD** per user/month.\n\n**2021 plan lineup (paid tiers):**\n\n- **BASIC** \u2013 **4.99 USD** per user/month  \n- **STANDARD** \u2013 **6.99 USD** per user/month  \n- **PRO** \u2013 **9.99 USD** per user/month  \n- **ENTERPRISE** \u2013 **14.99 USD** per user/month  \n\nBetween 2020 and 2021, Clockify added:\n\n- A **BASIC** plan at **4.99 USD** (new low entry point)\n- A **STANDARD** plan at **6.99 USD**\n\nThis creates **two paid options that are cheaper than the previous 9.99 USD floor**, giving lower\u2011budget users a way to pay less while still accessing advanced features.\n\n---\n\n### 2. Features moved down into cheaper plans\n\nSeveral capabilities that in 2020 required at least the 9.99\u2011USD tier are available in 2021 at **4.99 USD (BASIC)** or **6.99 USD (STANDARD)**, which is a clear budget improvement.\n\nExamples (with exact wording from the YAML):\n\n#### Administration & control features\n\nIn **2020**, many \u201ccontrol\u201d features started at **PLUS (9.99 USD)** or above:\n\n- `requiredFields` \u2013 \u201cDon't allow saving time with missing fields and information.\u201d  \n- `timeAudit` \u2013 \u201cFind entries without project and task, and with suspicious duration (too short or too long).\u201d  \n- `projectTemplates` \u2013 \u201cCreate new projects with the same structure from existing ones.\u201d  \n- `bulkEdit` \u2013 \u201cUpdate multiple time entries, projects, and users at once.\u201d  \n- `addTimeForOthers` (in PREMIUM/ENTERPRISE) \u2013 \u201cEdit your team's timesheet and calendar, and log time on their behalf.\u201d  \n- `hideTimeFromUsers` and `hidePages` \u2013 control what users can see.\n\nIn **2021**, equivalent or expanded controls are available starting from **BASIC (4.99 USD)**:\n\n- `addTimeForOthers` \u2013 included in **BASIC (4.99)**  \n- `hideTimeAndPages` \u2013 combines hiding time and pages, included in **BASIC (4.99)**  \n- `requiredFields` \u2013 **BASIC (4.99)**  \n- `bulkEdit` \u2013 **BASIC (4.99)**  \n- `timeAudit` \u2013 **BASIC (4.99)**  \n- `projectTemplates` \u2013 **BASIC (4.99)**  \n- Plus new helpful tools such as `decimalFormat`, `customizeExports`, `historicalRates`, and `importTimesheets` also in **BASIC**.\n\nSo, a small team that in 2020 would have needed to pay **9.99 USD per user/month** to get basic administration and quality\u2011control features can, in 2021, get many of those starting at **4.99 USD per user/month**.\n\n#### Timesheet approval & billing\n\nSome more advanced workflow/billing features also moved to a lower price point:\n\n- **2020**:  \n  - `timeApproval` (\u201cSubmit timesheets for manager review and approval.\u201d) and similar \u201cmanager\u201d features are limited to **ENTERPRISE**.\n- **2021**:  \n  - `timeApproval`, `timeOff`, `managerRole`, `targetsAndReminders`, `taskRates`, `timeRounding`, `invoicing`, `quickBooksIntegration` appear in **STANDARD (6.99 USD)** and above.\n\nThis means teams that need approval workflows and billing tools no longer have to jump to the highest tier; they can access them at **6.99 USD**, still below the old 9.99\u2011USD floor.\n\n---\n\n### 3. What did not get cheaper?\n\n- The **FREE** plan remains at **0 USD** in both snapshots, with core time\u2011tracking, projects, reports, apps, integrations, and API access enabled by default. There is no clear evidence (in this YAML) that free\u2011plan capabilities were significantly expanded between 2020 and 2021.\n- High\u2011end security and control features (`singleSignOn`, `customSubdomain`, `controlAccounts`) actually became **more expensive**, moving from an **ENTERPRISE** tier listed at **9.99 USD** to **14.99 USD** per user/month in 2021.\n\nThese changes primarily affect larger or more security\u2011sensitive organizations, not \u201clower\u2011budget\u201d users.\n\n---\n\n### Conclusion\n\nBetween 2020 and 2021, Clockify restructured its plans and feature bundles in a way that **clearly benefits lower\u2011budget users**:\n\n- Introduced cheaper paid tiers: **BASIC at 4.99 USD** and **STANDARD at 6.99 USD** per user/month (both below the previous 9.99\u2011USD entry point).\n- Moved many administration, control, and reporting features that were previously only available at **9.99 USD+** into these lower\u2011priced tiers.\n\nSo yes, Clockify did introduce configuration and packaging changes in that period which make advanced functionality accessible at lower monthly costs.",

            "answer": "Based on the 2022 vs 2023 pricing snapshots you provided for **CircleCI \u2013 Cloud**, there is one clear configuration change that *does* help lower\u2011budget users, and one that goes in the opposite direction.\n\n---\n\n## 1. Clear improvement for low\u2011budget / free users\n\n**Free plan user limit increased from 1 to 5 users at the same price (USD 0/month).**\n\n- **2022 defaults (used by FREE plan):**\n  - `maxUsers.defaultValue: 1 user`\n  - `creditsLimit.defaultValue: 30000 credit/month`\n- **2023 defaults (used by FREE plan):**\n  - `maxUsers.defaultValue: 5 user`\n  - `creditsLimit.defaultValue: 30000 credit/month`\n\nIn both years, the FREE plan is defined as:\n\n```yaml\nFREE:\n  price: 0\n  unit: /month\n  features: null\n  usageLimits: null\n```\n\nBecause `usageLimits` is `null`, the plan inherits the global defaults. Those defaults changed from **1 user** in 2022 to **5 users** in 2023, while the free credits remained at **30000 credit/month**.\n\n**Impact for low\u2011budget teams:**\n\n- A small team of up to **5 people** can now use CircleCI\u2019s free tier with:\n  - No subscription fee.\n  - The same **30000 credits/month** as before.\n- In 2022, that same team would have been constrained to **1 user** on the FREE plan and would generally have needed a paid plan (or a different account setup) to collaborate in a single account.\n\nThis is unambiguously **more generous for low\u2011budget users**, especially small teams that want collaboration without paying.\n\n---\n\n## 2. Change that *hurts* budget\u2011conscious paid users\n\nFor the entry\u2011level paid plan, **PERFORMANCE**, the price is unchanged but the included credits were reduced:\n\n**PERFORMANCE plan price:**\n\n- **2022:** `price: 15` `/month`\n- **2023:** `price: 15` `/month`  \n  \u2192 still **USD 15/month**\n\n**Included credits on PERFORMANCE:**\n\n- **2022 PERFORMANCE usage limits:**\n  ```yaml\n  PERFORMANCE:\n    price: 15\n    usageLimits:\n      creditsLimit:\n        value: 55000\n  ```\n- **2023 PERFORMANCE usage limits:**\n  ```yaml\n  PERFORMANCE:\n    price: 15\n    usageLimits:\n      creditsLimit:\n        value: 30000\n  ```\n\nSo:\n\n- 2022: **55,000 credits/month** for USD 15.\n- 2023: **30,000 credits/month** for USD 15.\n\nThat\u2019s a drop of **25,000 credits/month** (~45% fewer credits), making each *included* credit effectively more expensive for PERFORMANCE users. All other key limits on that plan (max 5 users, non\u2011Mac and Mac concurrency, etc.) stayed the same.\n\nFor budget\u2011conscious users who actually need paid capacity (not just the free tier), this is **worse**: you now get less compute for the same monthly fee and may need extra credit add\u2011ons sooner.\n\n---\n\n## 3. Other configuration changes and their budget relevance\n\nA few other changes are visible but are not clearly \u201cbudget improvements\u201d based on this data:\n\n- **Machine types renamed and expanded**  \n  - 2022 used names like `smallDockerVM`, `mediumDockerVM`, `mediumMacOsVM`, etc.\n  - 2023 uses more explicit architecture\u2011specific names such as `smallX86DockerVM`, `mediumX86PlusDockerVM`, `m1MediumMacOsVM`, `m1LargeMacOsVM`, etc.\n  - These likely reflect infrastructure updates (e.g., M1 Macs), but **no credit\u2011per\u2011machine pricing is included in the YAML**, so we cannot say from this data alone that they are cheaper or more cost\u2011efficient.\n\n- **Billing / payment configuration**\n  - 2022: `flexibleBillingOptions` (boolean, only enabled on SCALE).\n  - 2023: `paymentOptions` (TEXT), default `[CARD]`, and on SCALE set to `[INVOICE]`.\n  - This clarifies billing methods but doesn\u2019t show any direct per\u2011month price change or explicit discount for smaller customers.\n\n- **Plan catalog and add\u2011ons**\n  - The **plan lineup** is unchanged: `FREE`, `PERFORMANCE` (USD 15/month), `SCALE` (\u201cContact us\u201d).\n  - Add\u2011on prices and quantities are unchanged:\n    - `extraUsers` (PERFORMANCE): USD 15/month for +1 user.\n    - `extraCredits` (PERFORMANCE): USD 15/month for +25,000 credits.\n    - Premium support add\u2011ons remain the same.\n\nThese don\u2019t, by themselves, indicate a new advantage for low\u2011budget users.\n\n---\n\n## Conclusion\n\n**Yes, there *is* a configuration change between 2022 and 2023 that clearly helps users with a lower budget:**\n\n- The **FREE plan\u2019s maximum users increased from 1 to 5** while staying at **0 USD/month** and still including **30000 credits/month**.  \n  \u2192 This is a significant improvement for small teams that want to stay on the free tier.\n\n**However,** for users on the cheapest paid plan (**PERFORMANCE, USD 15/month**), the included credits were cut from **55,000** to **30,000**, which is **less favorable for budget\u2011conscious paid usage**.\n\nSo, from a low\u2011budget perspective:\n\n- **Free/small\u2011team users**: Better off in 2023.\n- **Entry\u2011level paid users needing substantial compute**: Worse off in 2023.",

            "answer": "Yes. Comparing the November 2019 and October 2020 configurations, ClickUp kept headline prices the same but **moved several capabilities down into the FREE tier and strengthened the lower\u2011priced plans**, while also introducing some limits. Overall, that *does* help users on a tighter budget, especially small teams and individuals.\n\nBelow is the concise breakdown based strictly on the configs you provided.\n\n---\n\n## 1. Prices: unchanged, value increased\n\nAcross both snapshots:\n\n- **FREE**: price **0 USD**  \n- **UNLIMITED**: **9 USD / member/month**  \n- **BUSINESS**: **19 USD / member/month**  \n- **ENTERPRISE**: **Contact Sales**\n\nSo any benefit to lower\u2011budget users comes from **more features and more granular options at the same prices**, not from lower list prices.\n\n---\n\n## 2. Major upgrades to the FREE plan (0 USD)\n\n### a. Features that were *paid-only* in 2019 but are enabled by default in 2020\n\nIn 2019, these had `defaultValue: false` and were only turned on in paid plans (e.g. UNLIMITED, BUSINESS, ENTERPRISE).  \nBy 2020 they are `defaultValue: true`, so the FREE plan inherits them:\n\n- **Guests**\n  - 2019: `guests` default false; only paid plans enabled it.\n  - 2020: `guests` default true; FREE can \u201cInvite guests to your Workspace.\u201d\n- **Custom fields**\n  - 2019: `customFields` default false; enabled only on UNLIMITED+.\n  - 2020: `customFields` default true; FREE gets **up to 100 uses/workspace** (`customFieldsLimit: 100`).\n- **Goals**\n  - 2019: `goals` default false; paid feature.\n  - 2020: `goals` default true; FREE can create up to **100 goals/workspace**.\n- **Portfolios**\n  - 2019: `portfolio` default false; paid feature.\n  - 2020: `portfolios` default true; FREE can use up to **100 portfolios/workspace**.\n- **Basic integrations**\n  - 2019: `integrations` default false; enabled only on paid plans.\n  - 2020: key integrations like  \n    - `nativeIntegrations`,  \n    - `zapier`,  \n    - `integromat`  \n    have `defaultValue: true`, so they\u2019re available on FREE.\n\nFor a budget\u2011constrained team, these are big: you can now have **guests, custom fields, goals, portfolios and core integrations without leaving the free plan**, as long as you stay within the usage caps.\n\n### b. New advanced features available even on FREE (with limits)\n\nIn 2019, the FREE plan effectively only had:\n\n- `tasks`, `storage`, `views`, and the `api`.\n\nBy 2020, many advanced capabilities are enabled by default (hence available to FREE), each governed by `usageLimits`:\n\nExamples (all with `defaultValue: true` in 2020):\n\n- **Project structure & organization**\n  - `spaces` (with `spacesLimit: 5` for FREE)\n  - `fileStorage` (with `fileStorageLimit: 100 MB` for FREE)\n- **Collaboration & security basics**\n  - `anytimeSupport` (support available on all plans)\n  - `privacy` (hide folders/lists/tasks)\n  - `sharing` (invite members & guests)\n- **Visualization & planning**\n  - `dashboards` (up to **100 per workspace** on FREE)\n  - `mindMaps` (up to **100 per workspace**)\n  - `ganttCharts` (up to **100 uses**)\n  - `timelineView` and `workloadView` (each up to **100 uses**)\n  - `activityView` (1\u2011day history for FREE)\n  - `milestones` (up to **10 uses**)\n- **Automation & reporting light**\n  - `automations` (FREE gets **10 automations/month**)\n  - `pulseLiveOverview` (up to **100 uses**)\n- **Agile & productivity tools**\n  - `sprints`\n  - `dependencies`\n  - `proofing`\n  - `timeTracking`\n  - `realTimeCollaboration`\n- **Guests**\n  - `guestsLimit` default value: **10,000,000**  \n    (and `readOnlyGuestsLimit: 0` for FREE, i.e., guests but no separate read\u2011only guest allowance explicitly modeled).\n\nFrom a low\u2011budget user\u2019s standpoint, this is a substantial qualitative upgrade: you get many \u201cpremium\u2011style\u201d features (dashboards, goals, portfolios, basic automations, guests, time tracking, Gantt/timeline/workload views) **without paying**, as long as your usage stays modest.\n\n---\n\n## 3. Improvements to the 9 USD \u201cUNLIMITED\u201d plan\n\nFor the **UNLIMITED** plan, the price is still **9 USD / member/month**, but the 2020 config includes more at that same level:\n\n- In 2019, UNLIMITED mainly added:\n  - `integrations`, `reporting`, `guests`, `permissions`, `goals`, `portfolio`, `customFields`.\n- In 2020, UNLIMITED includes, in addition to all default features, extra capabilities such as:\n  - `editPermissions`, `forms`, `boxView`\n  - `guestVisibility`\n  - `cloudStorage`\n  - `teams`\n  - `recurringTasksOnCalendar`\n  - `delegateReminders`\n  - External storage integrations: `googleDrive`, `dropbox`, `boxCloudStorage`, `oneDriveCloudStorage`\n\nAnd its usage limits are dramatically raised relative to the FREE defaults:\n\n- `spacesLimit`: **1,000,000,000**\n- `fileStorageLimit`: **1,000,000,000,000 MB** (effectively \u201cunlimited storage\u201d)\n- `automationsLimit`: **1000 automations/month**\n- `guestsLimit`: **5 full guests**, with `readOnlyGuestsLimit: .inf` (unlimited read\u2011only guests)\n\nSo for small paying teams with limited budgets, the **cost per user stayed at 9 USD but the feature set and capacity increased**, which is favorable from a value/price perspective.\n\n---\n\n## 4. New add\u2011ons for more granular spend (2020 only)\n\nThe 2020 configuration introduces **guest add\u2011ons** that weren\u2019t modeled in 2019:\n\n- **additionalFullGuestForUnlimited**\n  - Price: **5 USD / guest/month**\n  - Extends `guestsLimit` by **2** for the UNLIMITED plan.\n- **additionalFullGuestForBusiness**\n  - Price: **9 USD / guest/month**\n  - Extends `guestsLimit` by **5** for BUSINESS.\n- Enterprise: guest add\u2011on is **Contact Sales**.\n\nThis lets cost\u2011sensitive teams **buy just a few extra full guests instead of upgrading everyone or buying many extra seats**, which can be more budget\u2011friendly when you mainly collaborate with a small number of external partners/clients.\n\n---\n\n## 5. Trade\u2011offs: new limits on the FREE plan\n\nThere *are* some constraints that could hurt very budget\u2011heavy users of the free tier:\n\n- **Spaces**: FREE is limited to **5 spaces**.\n- **File storage**: FREE is limited to **100 MB** of `fileStorage`.\n- **Automations, dashboards, etc.**: capped numbers (e.g., **10 automations/month**, **100 dashboards**, **100 Gantt uses**, etc.).\n\nThe 2019 config for FREE did **not** explicitly define such limits, so for some heavy use\u2011cases the 2020 structure can push users toward paid tiers sooner, even though they now get more features.\n\n---\n\n## Conclusion\n\nBetween late 2019 and late 2020, ClickUp\u2019s configuration changed in ways that **largely benefit lower\u2011budget users**:\n\n- Prices for FREE, UNLIMITED, and BUSINESS stayed the same.\n- The FREE plan gained major capabilities (guests, custom fields, goals, portfolios, dashboards, automations, time tracking, advanced views, core integrations) with explicit but fairly generous caps.\n- The UNLIMITED plan at **9 USD/member/month** became richer (more features and much higher limits).\n- New guest add\u2011ons let small teams scale collaboration more cheaply and flexibly.\n\nThe only downside is that the 2020 setup introduces more explicit limits on the FREE tier\u2019s resources. For most light\u2011to\u2011moderate users, though, the **feature expansion at the same or zero price** is a net positive for anyone on a tight budget.",

Prices did **not** go down, but value did go up\n\nAcross both snapshots:\n\n- **BASIC_SHOPIFY**: `29 $` per user/month  \n- **SHOPIFY**: `79 $` per user/month  \n- **ADVANCED_SHOPIFY**: `299 $` per user/month  \n- **SHOPIFY_POS_PRO add\u2011on**: `89 $` per month  \n\nSo there was **no reduction** in subscription price between 2020 and 2021.\n\nCredit\u2011card processing and extra fees for not using Shopify Payments also stayed the same:\n\n- Basic: **2.9% + 30\u00a2 online**, **2.7% in\u2011person**, **+2%** if not using Shopify Payments  \n- Shopify: **2.6% + 30\u00a2 online**, **2.5% in\u2011person**, **+1%**  \n- Advanced: **2.4% + 30\u00a2 online**, **2.4% in\u2011person**, **+0.5%**\n\nSo the direct monthly and transaction fees did **not** change in favor of lower\u2011budget users.\n\n### 2. The big budget\u2011friendly change: **higher shipping discounts**, including on Basic\n\nWhere Shopify *did* make a clear, quantifiable improvement is in **shipping discounts**, which reduce per\u2011order costs.\n\nFrom the YAML + tool output:\n\n#### 2020 (shippingDiscountRate)\n\n- **BASIC_SHOPIFY**: `0.64`  \u2192 up to **64%** shipping discount  \n- **SHOPIFY**: overrides to `0.72` \u2192 up to **72%**  \n- **ADVANCED_SHOPIFY**: overrides to `0.74` \u2192 up to **74%**\n\n#### 2021 (shippingDiscountRate)\n\n- **BASIC_SHOPIFY**: default now `0.77` \u2192 up to **77%** shipping discount  \n- **SHOPIFY**: overrides to `0.88` \u2192 up to **88%**  \n- **ADVANCED_SHOPIFY**: overrides to `0.88` \u2192 up to **88%**\n\nSo for a low\u2011budget merchant on **Basic at 29 $**:\n\n- In 2020, they got **up to 64% off** carrier rates (\u201cCompetitive shipping rates from USPS, UPS, or DHL Express\u201d).\n- By 2021, at the **same 29 $ price**, they now get **up to 77% off** (\u201cCompetitive shipping rates from DHL Express, UPS, or USPS\u201d).\n\nThat 13\u2011percentage\u2011point improvement directly **reduces variable shipping costs per order** without requiring an upgrade or add\u2011on.  \nThis is the clearest configuration change that materially helps lower\u2011budget users.\n\n### 3. Extra built\u2011in features on Basic that can reduce external spend\n\nAt the same **29 $** Basic price, the 2021 configuration exposes several features that can lower the need for third\u2011party apps or higher plans:\n\nOn **BASIC_SHOPIFY 2021** (vs 2020), you see:\n\n- **Global selling tools included by default**\n  - `sellInCurrencies` \u2013 price rounding and multi\u2011currency selling.\n  - `sellInMultipleLanguages` \u2013 with `sellInMultipleLanguagesCap: 20` languages.\n  - These let a small merchant sell internationally **without upgrading plans** or necessarily paying for separate localization / FX apps.\n\n- **Fraud and marketing tools explicitly included**\n  - `fraudAnalysis` \u2013 built\u2011in fraud checks (reduces potential chargeback costs and the need for some third\u2011party fraud tools).\n  - `abandonedCartRecovery` \u2013 can recover lost revenue without needing a separate email/marketing app.\n  - `reports` (with a `reportType` limit) \u2013 built\u2011in reporting at the Basic tier, avoiding an upgrade purely for analytics.\n\n- **Standard infrastructure included**\n  - `freeSslCertificate` \u2013 avoids buying and managing SSL separately.\n  - `shippingLabels` \u2013 label printing with no special equipment, building on the discounted shipping.\n\nWhile some feature names and groupings changed between 2020 and 2021 (e.g., old \u201csocialSelling/integratedMarketingPlatform\u201d vs new \u201csalesChannels/abandonedCartRecovery\u201d), the net effect for a budget\u2011conscious merchant is:\n\n- **Same monthly price (29 $)**  \n- **Higher shipping discounts (64% \u2192 77%)**  \n- **More built\u2011in tools for global selling, fraud analysis, and cart recovery**, reducing reliance on paid apps or higher tiers.\n\n### Conclusion\n\nBetween late 2020 and late 2021, Shopify did **not** lower its subscription prices or payment fees, but it **did introduce configuration changes that help lower\u2011budget users**, especially on the Basic plan:\n\n- **Substantially better shipping discounts** at the same 29 $ price.  \n- **Additional built\u2011in capabilities** (global selling, fraud analysis, cart recovery, reporting) that can reduce the need to spend on third\u2011party tools or higher\u2011tier plans.\n\nSo, yes\u2014there were meaningful configuration changes that make Shopify more budget\u2011friendly for lower\u2011budget merchants in that period, primarily via reduced shipping costs and added value at the entry\u2011level price point.",

They just need to have an Overleaf account. They can be different people in each project.\u201d\n\nSo, per project you can have **up to 6 people actively working together** (you + up to 5 others, or any combination totaling 6), and you can choose **different sets of 6 per project**.\n\n### Is that sufficient for \u201cimproving business efficiency\u201d?\n\nIt depends on how your teams actually work:\n\n**Likely sufficient if:**\n- Each document is created by a **small, focused team** (e.g., 2\u20135 people: author, co-author(s), maybe one reviewer).\n- You don\u2019t need more than **6 concurrent editors** on the *same* project at the same time.\n- Most stakeholders just need outputs (PDFs) or occasional involvement, rather than continuous editing access.\n\n**Potentially limiting (hurting efficiency) if:**\n- You routinely have **larger cross\u2011functional teams** (e.g., 7\u201312 people: multiple authors, QA, legal, marketing, managers) all needing edit access to the **same Overleaf project**.\n- You anticipate documents where **many contributors edit in parallel** (e.g., large proposals, complex technical specs, or multi\u2011team reports).\n\nIn those cases, constantly adding/removing collaborators to stay under the 6\u2011person cap becomes an administrative overhead and can slow people down. Then a higher plan is more \u201cefficient\u201d operationally:\n\n- **Standard plan**: up to **10 collaborators per project** (price: **21 USD/month**)\n- **Professional plan**: **unlimited collaborators per project** (price: **42 USD/month**)\n\n### Other efficiency-related aspects of the Student plan\n\nFrom the pricing data, the Student plan at **9 USD/month** includes many features that *do* support efficiency, such as:\n\n- **realTimeTrackChanges** and **fullDocumentHistory** \u2013 detailed change tracking and version history.\n- **gitIntegration**, **githubIntegration**, **dropboxIntegration**, **Mendeley/Zotero integration** \u2013 better workflows with existing tools.\n- **advancedReferenceSearch**, **symbolPalette**, and **fastestCompileServers** with a **4\u2011minute compile timeout**.\n\nSo, from a features perspective, it is well-equipped for efficient work; the only real structural constraint for collaboration is that **6\u2011person cap per project**.\n\n### Practical recommendation\n\n- **If almost all of your projects will have \u2264 6 active editors at once:**  \n  The Student plan\u2019s collaborator limit is likely *sufficient* for improving efficiency, especially given the strong feature set.\n\n- **If you foresee regular projects where 7+ people must edit the same document simultaneously:**  \n  For smooth, efficient collaboration, you should plan on **Standard (10 collaborators)** or **Professional (unlimited)** instead of Student.\n\nFinally, this pricing spec doesn\u2019t state eligibility rules; you should check on Overleaf\u2019s site whether the **Student plan is permitted for your kind of business use**, even if the collaborator limit itself would be sufficient.",

            "answer": "For the **CircleCI \u2013 Cloud Performance plan**, the pricing file you provided says:\n\n- **Price:** `15 USD /month`\n- **Included non-renewable credits:** `25,000` (usageLimit `nonRenewableCredits: value: 25000`)\n- **Global \u201crenewable\u201d credits:** `2,500 credits/week` (from `renewableCredits` default)\n- **Other key limits/features in Performance:**\n  - `maxUsers: 3`\n  - Concurrency: `80` non\u2011macOS jobs, `15` macOS jobs\n  - Larger machine types (medium+/large/xlarge Docker & Linux, macOS, Windows)\n  - Docker layer caching\n  - Ticket-based global support\n\nSo, out of the box you effectively have:\n\n- A **recurring allowance** of **2,500 renewable credits per week**, plus  \n- A **finite pool** of **25,000 non\u2011renewable credits** that get consumed only when you go beyond the renewable weekly allowance (and don\u2019t automatically refill).\n\nWhether that is \u201csufficient for improving business efficiency\u201d depends on your workload, not just the plan:\n\n---\n\n### What the credits mean in practice\n\nThe YAML does **not** specify how many credits each VM size uses per minute. That mapping comes from CircleCI\u2019s runtime pricing tables (e.g., \u201cmedium Linux uses X credits/minute\u201d), which are not in this file and have changed over time. Because of that, I can\u2019t tell you, for example, \u201c25,000 credits = N hours of compute\u201d with certainty.\n\nHowever, the logic to decide sufficiency is:\n\n1. **Estimate your current or planned usage in credits**\n   - From CircleCI\u2019s docs, find how many credits your chosen executors cost per minute (Linux vs Windows vs macOS, size of VM, etc.).\n   - For each typical pipeline run:\n     - Credits per run = (credits/min for chosen machine(s)) \u00d7 (minutes used per run)  \n       (sum across jobs if multiple machines or parallel jobs).\n   - Monthly credits \u2248 (credits per run) \u00d7 (runs per month).\n\n2. **Compare that with what the Performance plan provides**\n   - **Recurring:** \u2248 `2,500 credits/week` \u2192 about `10,000 credits/month` (4 weeks).\n   - **Finite bucket:** `25,000` non\u2011renewable credits.\n   - Roughly, you can support up to about:\n     - ~`10,000 credits/month` on an ongoing basis **without** ever touching the non\u2011renewable pool, plus\n     - A **buffer of 25,000 credits** for bursts, experiments, or growth.\n   - Once that 25,000 pool is gone, you\u2019re effectively operating only on the 2,500 credits/week unless you buy more.\n\n3. **If it\u2019s not enough, you can scale incrementally**\n   - Add\u2011on `extraCredits` for the Performance plan:\n     - Price: `15 USD /month`\n     - Each add-on gives **another 25,000 non\u2011renewable credits**.\n   - So your marginal cost of compute is:\n     - `15 USD` for each additional `25,000` credits (i.e., `0.0006 USD` per credit, `0.60 USD` per 1,000 credits).\n\n---\n\n### Interpreting this for \u201cbusiness efficiency\u201d\n\nThe **efficiency gains** from moving to Performance mainly come from:\n\n- Much higher concurrency (`80` non\u2011macOS / `15` macOS jobs) \u2192 faster feedback for developers.\n- Larger machine sizes + Docker layer caching \u2192 shorter build/test times.\n- Some support improvements.\n\nCredits are more about **how much of that faster CI you can afford to run**.\n\nSo:\n\n- If you are a **small team (\u22643 active developers)** with:\n  - A few repositories,\n  - Pipelines that run only on pushes/PRs (not on heavy schedules),\n  - Mostly using small/medium Linux or Docker machines,\n  \n  then **Performance with 25,000 non\u2011renewable credits is typically enough** to:\n  - Unlock higher concurrency and caching,\n  - Run daily CI comfortably,\n  - Experiment with pipeline improvements,\n  **and** still have room before needing extra credit packs.\n\n- If you:\n  - Run **many builds per day** (e.g., dozens or hundreds),\n  - Use **large/xlarge machines** or **macOS/Windows** heavily,\n  - Have **lots of parallel jobs** across many services,\n\n  then you will likely **burn through the 25,000 non\u2011renewable credits relatively quickly** and should plan on:\n  - Buying one or more `extraCredits` add-ons (each +25,000 credits for `15 USD /month`), or\n  - Considering the **SCALE** plan (which in this pricing file has `.inf` non\u2011renewable credits and concurrency, but \u201cContact us\u201d pricing).\n\n---\n\n### How to decide concretely\n\nTo answer \u201cis it sufficient?\u201d for your case:\n\n1. **Measure current usage:**\n   - If you\u2019re already on CircleCI, look at \u201ccredits used per week/month\u201d in your org\u2019s billing/usage dashboard.\n   - If you\u2019re not, approximate from build minutes on your current CI multiplied by CircleCI\u2019s published credits/minute for comparable machines.\n\n2. **Compare to these thresholds (using the YAML numbers):**\n   - If your **expected monthly credits** are:\n     - **< 10,000/month:** The weekly renewable allowance likely covers you; the 25,000 non\u2011renewable bucket is a large buffer \u2192 **Performance credits are more than sufficient**.\n     - **10,000\u201335,000/month:** You\u2019ll draw down the 25,000 pool over time. Still fine to improve efficiency now, but you should monitor and expect to buy extra packs later.\n     - **> 35,000/month on an ongoing basis:** Plan from the start to add `extraCredits` (or discuss SCALE), because the base 25,000 non\u2011renewable credits will be exhausted fairly quickly.\n\n---\n\n**Bottom line:**  \nThe **Performance plan\u2019s 25,000 non\u2011renewable credits plus 2,500 renewable credits/week are sufficient for improving business efficiency for small-to-moderate workloads**, and the pricing model is designed so you can scale up cheaply with `extraCredits` add-ons. For heavy CI usage, they\u2019re a **starter pool, not a long-term ceiling**\u2014you\u2019ll need to size your credits based on your actual or projected build minutes.",

            "answer": "Among the three products, the configuration with the strongest *report\u2011customization* capabilities is:\n\n> **Deskera \u2013 ERP \u00b7 MID_MARKET plan**  \n> **Cost:** `249 $` (currency in the YAML is USD, unit: user/month)  \n> **Why:** It is the only option that bundles **all three dedicated customization features**\u2014`reportBuilder`, `customReports`, and `customDashboards`\u2014on top of an extensive set of built\u2011in reports.\n\n### How I evaluated \u201cbest\u201d\n\nFor each SaaS, I asked the optimizer to find the **cheapest plan that still includes its key report\u2011customization features**:\n\n1. **Buffer (social media management & analytics)**\n   - **Target features:** `customAnalytics`, `reportsSpreadsheet`, `reportsPDF`, `reportsImages`, `brandedReports`\n   - **Optimal configuration:**  \n     - **Plan:** `TEAM`  \n     - **Cost:** `12 $` (USD, per channel/month)  \n     - **Why this plan:**  \n       - It\u2019s the lowest\u2011priced Buffer plan that includes **all** of:\n         - `customAnalytics` \u2013 customize analytics by tagging content.\n         - `reportsSpreadsheet`, `reportsPDF`, `reportsImages` \u2013 export \u201cbeautiful reports\u201d to spreadsheet, PDF, or images.\n         - `brandedReports` \u2013 add your logo and generate a cover page.\n       - Cheaper plan **ESSENTIALS** lacks `brandedReports`, so it fails the feature requirement.\n\n   - **Best for:** Low\u2011cost, **social\u2011media\u2013focused** report customization (tag-based analytics + branded, multi\u2011format exports).\n\n2. **Planable (social media collaboration & planning)**\n   - **Target feature:** `customReports`\n   - **Optimal configuration:**  \n     - **Plan:** `BASIC`  \n     - **Add\u2011on:** `analyticsAndReporting`  \n     - **Cost:** `42 $`  \n       - Derived from BASIC (`33 $` per workspace/month) + analyticsAndReporting add\u2011on (`9 $` per user/month/workspace) for one user; the tool reports the combined `42 $`.\n   - **Why this combo:**\n     - The **analyticsAndReporting** add\u2011on is what unlocks:\n       - `pageLevelInsights`\n       - `postLevelMetrics`\n       - `customReports`\n       - `audienceInsights`\n     - It\u2019s available on BASIC, PRO, and ENTERPRISE; BASIC + add\u2011on is the **cheapest** way to get `customReports`.  \n       - PRO + add\u2011on or ENTERPRISE + add\u2011on would be more expensive.\n\n   - **Best for:** Teams that primarily need **social content planning and collaboration**, with the ability to generate **custom performance reports**, but don\u2019t need a full, cross\u2011department reporting suite.\n\n3. **Deskera \u2013 ERP (ERP/CRM/HR + analytics)**\n   - **Target features:** `reportBuilder`, `customReports`, `customDashboards`\n   - **Optimal configuration:**  \n     - **Plan:** `MID_MARKET`  \n     - **Cost:** `249 $` (unit: user/month)  \n     - **Why this plan:**\n       - `GROWTH` doesn\u2019t enable these report\u2011customization features (their defaults are `false`).\n       - `MID_MARKET` is the **lowest\u2011priced** plan that explicitly sets all three to `true`:\n         - `reportBuilder`\n         - `customReports`\n         - `customDashboards`\n       - It also includes a broad set of built\u2011in reports:\n         - `financialReports`\n         - `salesReports`\n         - `purchaseReports`\n         - `invetoryReports` (inventory)\n         - `warehouseReports`\n         - `crmReports`\n       - `ENTERPRISE` also has them, but is \u201cContact Sales\u201d (and therefore not cost\u2011minimal).\n\n   - **Best for:** Organizations that want **deep, flexible report customization across finance, sales, inventory, CRM, and HR**\u2014not just marketing or social\u2011media analytics.\n\n### Overall \u201cbest\u201d for report customization\n\n- **Most powerful and comprehensive:**  \n  **Deskera \u2013 ERP \u00b7 MID_MARKET (`249 $`)**  \n  - Only option with a dedicated **`reportBuilder` + `customReports` + `customDashboards`** stack.\n  - Sits on top of rich, cross\u2011functional data (accounting, sales, inventory, CRM, HR), giving you the widest canvas for custom reporting.\n\n- **Best low\u2011cost option for social media reporting:**  \n  **Buffer \u00b7 TEAM (`12 $` per channel/month)**  \n  - Strong for customizable analytics within social media: tagging\u2011based analytics, multi\u2011format exports, and branded reports.\n\n- **Mid\u2011range, social\u2011media collaboration focus:**  \n  **Planable \u00b7 BASIC + analyticsAndReporting (`42 $`)**  \n  - Unlocks `customReports` and detailed insights, but in a narrower domain (social publishing & planning) and without a separate `reportBuilder` or `customDashboards`.\n\nIf your priority is **maximum flexibility and depth of report customization across many business functions**, the **Deskera MID_MARKET** configuration is the best among these products.  \nIf you clarify whether you care only about **social media** or about **company\u2011wide** reporting, I can narrow this to a single recommendation for your specific use case.",

Unlimited guests and file uploads; 30\u2011day version history. |\n| **Overleaf** | **STUDENT**     | **8 $** per month       | `prioritySupport: true` | LaTeX\u2011focused; up to 6 collaborators per project; extended compile timeout (4 minutes). |\n| **ClickUp**  | **BUSINESS_PLUS** | **29 $** per member/month | `prioritySupport: true` with description: \u201cReceive an enhanced level of support to quickly resolve your highest priority issues\u201d | Also includes 24/7 \u201canytimeSupport\u201d, live chat support, admin training webinar, and many advanced team / workload features. |\n\nThe solver outputs:\n\n- Overleaf optimal for `prioritySupport`: **STUDENT**, cost **\"8 $\"**\n- ClickUp optimal for `prioritySupport`: **BUSINESS_PLUS**, cost **\"29 $\"**\n- Notion optimal for `prioritySupport`: **PERSONAL_PRO**, cost **\"5 $\"**\n\nComparing these, **Notion PERSONAL_PRO at 5 $** is the **lowest\u2011cost plan that includes `prioritySupport`** across all three products.\n\n---\n\n### Why PERSONAL_PRO (Notion) is \u201cbest\u201d under this analysis\n\n- Our optimization explicitly aimed to **minimize price** subject to the feature filter `prioritySupport`.\n- **Notion PERSONAL_PRO** is the **cheapest** plan containing `prioritySupport` (5 $ vs 8 $ vs 29 $).\n- It also removes major free\u2011tier constraints (infinite guests and file uploads, 30\u2011day version history, etc.), making it a strong value for an individual user who needs faster/more responsive support.\n\n---\n\n### Important caveats\n\n- **Different products, different purposes**: Overleaf (LaTeX editor), ClickUp (work management), and Notion (docs/wiki/databases) solve different problems. In practice you\u2019d pick the product for its core functionality first, then choose the cheapest plan with `prioritySupport` in that product.\n- **Teams vs individuals**:\n  - Notion **PERSONAL_PRO** is effectively for a **single member** (default `membersLimit: 1`). For multi\u2011member workspaces, you\u2019d need **Notion TEAM** (10 $) or **ENTERPRISE**.\n  - ClickUp\u2019s **BUSINESS_PLUS** and **ENTERPRISE** plans are oriented toward multi\u2011team organizations and also offer richer support (e.g., dedicated customer success, onboarding workshops on ENTERPRISE) but ENTERPRISE pricing is \u201cContact Sales\u201d, so it wasn\u2019t included in the numeric optimization.\n- Because ENTERPRISE plans for ClickUp and Notion have **non\u2011numeric (\u201cContact Sales\u201d) prices**, they were **not considered** in the \u201cbest by lowest cost\u201d comparison, even though they may offer higher\u2011touch support.\n\n---\n\n**Answer in one line:**  \nUnder the cost\u2011minimizing assumption, the best configuration across these SaaS products for getting priority support is **Notion\u2019s PERSONAL_PRO plan at 5 $ per user/month**.",

            "answer": "For each SaaS, the cheapest configuration that includes programmatic API access is:\n\n---\n\n## 1. Clockify \u2013 Time tracking via API\n\n- **Optimal plan for API use:** `FREE`\n- **Cost:** `0 $` (price: 0, unit: user/month, currency: USD)\n- **Why this plan:**  \n  The `api` feature\u2019s default is `true`, and the `FREE` plan does not override it, so the API is fully available at no cost.\n\n- **Relevant details from pricing:**\n  - **API feature:**  \n    - Name: `api`  \n    - Type: INTEGRATION (integrationType: `API`)  \n    - Description: *\u201cPush and pull data to and from Clockify, and connect with your systems.\u201d*\n  - **Other default features you also get on FREE:**\n    - `unlimitedTracking`, `unlimitedProjects`, `unlimitedReports`\n    - `apps` (mobile, desktop, browser extension)\n    - `integrations`\n    - `emailSupport`, `chatSupport`\n  - Usage limits for tracking/projects/reports are set to extremely high defaults (effectively \u201cunlimited\u201d for typical use).\n\n**Conclusion for Clockify:**  \nTo use Clockify via API as cheaply as possible, choose the **FREE** plan; you get full API access with effectively unlimited usage at **0 $ per user/month**.\n\n---\n\n## 2. Figma \u2013 Design tool via REST APIs\n\n- **Optimal plan for API use:** `STARTER`\n- **Cost (from solver result):** `0 $` (price: 0, unit: editor/month, currency: USD)\n- **Why this plan:**  \n  The `restApis` feature has a default value of `true`, and the `STARTER` plan does not restrict it. The solver, minimizing price subject to `restApis`, identified **STARTER** as optimal.\n\n- **Relevant details from pricing:**\n  - **API feature:**\n    - Name: `restApis`  \n    - Type: INTEGRATION (integrationType: `MARKETPLACE`)  \n    - Default: `true` \u2192 available on all plans unless overridden (and it is not).\n  - On `STARTER`, features are `null`, which means:  \n    - All defaults apply: `versionHistory`, `figmaEditor`, `plugins`, `fileStorage`, `components`, `thirdPartyIntegrations`, `liveEmbeds`, `singleSignOn`, and **`restApis`**.\n  - **Usage limit relevant to code / automation:**\n    - `versionHistoryDepth`: default 30 days on `STARTER`.\n\n**Conclusion for Figma:**  \nTo use Figma via REST APIs at the minimum cost, pick the **STARTER** plan. It provides `restApis` plus core collaboration and integration features at **0 $ per editor/month**.\n\n---\n\n## 3. Zenhub \u2013 GitHub project management via API\n\n- **Tool result:**  \n  The optimization step for `apiAccess` failed with:  \n  > `\"Invalid datafile. No two plans should be exactly the same.\"`  \n\n  This is a tooling constraint: it seems to reject the file because multiple plans share the same feature set (features are mostly defaulted and identical), even though they differ in price and usage limits.\n\n- **Manual analysis from YAML:**\n\n  - **API feature:**\n    - Name: `apiAccess`\n    - Type: INTEGRATION (integrationType: `API`)\n    - Default: `true` \u2192 applies to all plans unless overridden (it is not).\n\n  - **Usage limit tied to the API and other core features:**\n    - `onlyForPublicRepos` (type: NON_RENEWABLE, default: `true`)\n    - Linked to: `apiAccess`, `burnDownCharts`, `estimates`, `epics`, `unlimitedRepositories`, `multiRepoBoard`, `slackIntegration`, `cloudHosted`.\n\n  - **Plans:**\n    1. **`FREE`**\n       - Price: 0 (`unit: /month`)\n       - Features: `null` \u2192 all defaults, including `apiAccess: true`.\n       - UsageLimits: `null` \u2192 uses default `onlyForPublicRepos: true`.\n       - **Effect:** API access is **free**, but limited to **public repositories only**.\n\n    2. **`GROWTH`**\n       - Price: 5 (`unit: user/month`)\n       - Features: `null` \u2192 same defaults (including `apiAccess: true`).\n       - UsageLimits:\n         - `onlyForPublicRepos: false` (override).\n       - **Effect:** API access for **public and private repos**, at **5 USD per user/month**.\n\n    3. **`ENTERPRISE`**\n       - Price: 12.5 (`unit: 'user/month'`)\n       - Features:\n         - `onPremisesHostingOnAwsServers: true`\n         - `24-5TechSupport: true`\n         - `unlimitedReposAccrossGithubOrgs: true`\n       - UsageLimits:\n         - `onlyForPublicRepos: false`\n       - **Effect:** API access for private repos, plus on-prem hosting options, higher support, and cross-organization repo limits at **12.5 USD per user/month**.\n\n**Conclusions for Zenhub:**\n\n- If you only need API access for **public GitHub repositories**, the best configuration is:\n  - **Plan:** `FREE`  \n  - **Cost:** 0 (currency USD)  \n  - **Rationale:** includes `apiAccess` by default; restriction is only that it\u2019s *only for public repos* via `onlyForPublicRepos: true`.\n\n- If you need API access to **private repositories**, the cheapest qualifying plan is:\n  - **Plan:** `GROWTH`  \n  - **Cost:** 5 USD per user/month  \n  - **Rationale:** it sets `onlyForPublicRepos: false`, lifting the public-only restriction while keeping `apiAccess` enabled.\n\n---\n\n## 4. Overall \u201cbest configuration\u201d across all three\n\nBased purely on subscription **cost** and the requirement \u201cuse via API\u201d, the minimum-price options that satisfy the relevant API feature for each product are:\n\n- **Clockify:** `FREE` \u2013 `api` enabled \u2013 **0 $ per user/month**  \n- **Figma:** `STARTER` \u2013 `restApis` enabled \u2013 **0 $ per editor/month**  \n- **Zenhub:**  \n  - For public repos only: `FREE` \u2013 `apiAccess` enabled \u2013 **0 $ per month**  \n  - For public + private repos: `GROWTH` \u2013 `apiAccess` enabled \u2013 **5 USD per user/month**\n\nThe optimization solver\u2019s global summary reported:\n\n```json\n{\"bestPlan\": {\"plan\": \"STARTER\", \"cost\": \"0 $\", \"addOns\": []}}\n```\n\nThis corresponds to **Figma\u2019s STARTER** plan and reflects that it found a 0-cost plan with the requested API feature. However, from the full context we know there is a **three-way tie at 0 $** (Clockify FREE, Figma STARTER, Zenhub FREE) when only price and API availability are considered.\n\n**Practical takeaway:**\n\n- For **time tracking via API** \u2192 use **Clockify FREE**.  \n- For **design files and prototypes via API** \u2192 use **Figma STARTER**.  \n- For **GitHub-based project management via API** \u2192  \n  - **Zenhub FREE** if you only need public repos,  \n  - **Zenhub GROWTH** if you need private-repo access.  \n\nIf you tell me what you\u2019re trying to integrate (time tracking, design asset automation, GitHub workflows, or a mix), I can recommend a more specific configuration and expected combined monthly cost.",

Please check the pricing data or contact sales.\u201d\n  - In the YAML, the `SCALE` plan price is `\"Contact us\"`, so we **don\u2019t have a numeric cost** to compare.  \n    - From the same YAML, a purely numeric alternative to reach 100 users on CircleCI would be:\n      - `PERFORMANCE` plan: price 15 /month, includes 5 users.\n      - `extraUsers` add-on: price 15 /month per additional user, adds 1 to `maxUsers`, available for `PERFORMANCE`.\n      - For 100 users: 5 included + 95 extra \u2192 95 \u00d7 15 = 1425, plus 15 base = **1440 $/month**.\n    - That\u2019s vastly higher than 0 $, and the enterprise `SCALE` plan (contact sales) is very unlikely to be cheaper than free.\n\n### Conclusion\n\n- **Across all three SaaS products, the best (cheapest) configuration for managing at least 100 users is:**\n  - **Clockify \u2013 `FREE` plan, cost `0 $`, with `unlimitedUsers`.**\n- Trustmary\u2019s `STARTER` at `29 $`/month is the next-cheapest option with unlimited team members.\n- CircleCI\u2019s `SCALE` plan supports unlimited users but has a non-numeric \u201cContact us\u201d price; the only fully numeric 100\u2011user configuration there (`PERFORMANCE` + 95 `extraUsers` add-ons) is on the order of **1440 $/month**, far above Clockify\u2019s free offering.\n\nIf you tell me which type of functionality you actually care about (CI/CD, surveys, or time tracking), I can refine which \u201cbest\u201d configuration makes sense beyond just price.",

            "answer": "Among Evernote, Jira, and Wrike, the **cheapest configuration that gives you iOS and Android app access is the \u201cFREE\u201d plan for each product**. All three tools include their mobile apps on iOS and Android by default in the free tier, and no add\u2011ons are required.\n\nBecause we optimized for **minimum price** subject to \u201cmust have iOS + Android apps,\u201d each solver run chose the `FREE` plan at a cost of **\"0 $\"** (as returned by the tools). There is no cheaper option.\n\n### Per\u2011product results\n\n#### 1. Evernote\n- **Chosen plan:** `FREE`  \n- **Cost (tool result):** `\"0 $\"` (currency in the YAML is USD)  \n- **Why this plan:**  \n  - The required features `appForIOS` and `appForAndroid` are defined with `defaultValue: true`, so they are included in **all** plans.\n  - When we filter for those features and minimize cost, the `FREE` plan (price 0) is the cheapest that satisfies the requirement.\n\n- **Relevant included features (from the pricing YAML):**\n  - `appForIOS`, `appForAndroid`, plus:\n    - `syncAcrossDevices` (sync between devices)\n    - `notes`, `notebooks`, `tasks`, `offlineNotes`\n    - `appForWindows`, `appForMac`, `appForWeb`\n- **Key limitation that may matter:**\n  - `syncAccrossDevicesLimit` = 2 devices on `FREE`. If you want both iOS and Android plus, say, a laptop all syncing at once, you\u2019d hit this limit and might need a paid plan.\n\n#### 2. Jira\n- **Chosen plan:** `FREE`  \n- **Cost (tool result):** `\"0 $\"` (unit in YAML: user/month)  \n- **Why this plan:**\n  - The mobile feature `iosAndAndroidApps` has `defaultValue: true`, so every Jira plan has iOS and Android apps.\n  - With the constraint \u201cmust have `iosAndAndroidApps`\u201d and objective \u201cminimize price,\u201d the `FREE` plan at 0 is optimal.\n\n- **Relevant included features:**\n  - `iosAndAndroidApps` (Jira mobile apps for iOS & Android)\n  - Core work features like `goals`, `issues`, `projects`, `dashboards`, `automation`, etc.\n- **Key limits:**\n  - `usersLimit` = 10 users per site\n  - `storageLimit` = 2 GB  \n  None of these affect simply having mobile app access.\n\n#### 3. Wrike\n- **Chosen plan:** `FREE`  \n- **Cost (tool result):** `\"0 $\"` (unit in YAML: user/month)  \n- **Why this plan:**\n  - The feature `wrikeIOSAndAndroidApps` has `defaultValue: true`, so Wrike\u2019s iOS and Android apps are available on all plans.\n  - Filtering for `wrikeIOSAndAndroidApps` and minimizing price yields the `FREE` plan at 0 as the optimal choice.\n\n- **Relevant included features:**\n  - `wrikeIOSAndAndroidApps` (Wrike\u2019s iOS & Android apps)\n  - `wrikeForWindowsAndMac` (desktop apps)\n  - Core collaboration features like `taskManagement`, `subtaskManagement`, `folderHierachy`, `openRESTfulAPI`, `cloudStoragePlatforms`, etc.\n- **Key limits:**\n  - `useStorageAccount` = 2 GB/account\n  - `minNumberOfUsers` = 1 (you can use it solo)\n\n### So what is the \u201cbest\u201d configuration?\n\nFrom a **pure \u201ciOS + Android app access at lowest cost\u201d** standpoint:\n\n- **Evernote `FREE`**, **Jira `FREE`**, and **Wrike `FREE`** are all equally optimal:\n  - Each includes its iOS and Android apps by default.\n  - Each was selected by the optimization as the cheapest valid plan at **\"0 $\"**.\n\nWhich is *best* for you then depends on what you\u2019re trying to do:\n\n- Personal notes and organizing information: **Evernote `FREE`**\n- Issue/bug tracking and lightweight project management for small teams: **Jira `FREE`**\n- Task and project/work management with more flexible hierarchy: **Wrike `FREE`**\n\nIf you tell me your primary use case (note\u2011taking, software development, general project management, team size, number of devices you\u2019ll sync), I can recommend one concrete \u201cbest\u201d choice among these free plans.",

All the \u201ctop\u201d non\u2011Enterprise features are already unlocked at the ADVANCED level.\n\n## Why this is the best configuration under your budget\n\nAmong all numeric\u2011priced plans and add\u2011ons (FREE, PLUS, FAMILY, PROFESSIONAL, STANDARD, ADVANCED and their add\u2011ons):\n\n- **ADVANCED** includes **every feature in STANDARD and PROFESSIONAL**, plus additional high\u2011end security and admin capabilities.\n- **ENTERPRISE** may have more, but it\u2019s listed as **\u201cContact Sales\u201d** with no concrete price, so it cannot be safely evaluated against a fixed $168/month budget.\n\nSo **ADVANCED + 1 extra user** is the highest\u2011feature option with a known price under your budget.\n\n## Key capabilities you get with ADVANCED (+1 user)\n\nFrom the pricing file, this configuration includes:\n\n**Storage & file history**\n- **Unlimited storage** (`storageLimit: .inf`)\n- Extended **file recovery and version history**: 180 days\n- **Dropbox Rewind** back 180 days\n\n**Advanced security & compliance**\n- **Single Sign-On (SSO)** with identity providers\n- **Enable HIPAA compliance** option\n- **Data classification**\n- **Ransomware detection and recovery**\n- **Alerts and notifications** (security/activity tracking)\n- **Audit logs with file event tracking**\n- **Device approvals** and **remote device wipe**\n- **Dropbox Vault**, **256\u2011bit AES**, **SSL/TLS encryption**\n- **Dropbox Passwords** for credential management\n\n**Sharing, collaboration & control**\n- **Shared link controls** (restrict who can access links, etc.)\n- **External sharing controls & reporting**\n- **Watermarking** for shared files\n- **Branded sharing**\n- **Viewer history** (who viewed files)\n- **File locking**\n- **Dropbox Transfer** up to 100 GB per transfer with customization\n- All core collaboration tools: Dropbox Paper, Capture, Transfer, file requests, full\u2011text search, comments, previews, etc.\n\n**Admin & governance**\n- **Admin console**, **multi\u2011team admin login**\n- **Tiered admin roles**\n- **Sign in as user**\n- **Company\u2011managed groups**\n- **Account transfer tool**\n- **Invite enforcement**\n- **Centralized billing**\n- **API access** to security, productivity, and data\u2011transport partners\n\n**Support**\n- **Priority email support**\n- **Live chat support**\n- **Phone support during business hours**\n\n## If you don\u2019t need 4 users\n\nIf you need fewer seats, you could choose **ADVANCED with no add\u2011ons (3 users)** at **72 $/month**, and you\u2019d get the **same features** with one fewer user; the features are tied to the plan level, not the number of seats.\n\n---\n\n**Bottom line:**  \nThe configuration that gives you the richest feature set without exceeding **$168/month** is:\n\n> **Dropbox ADVANCED plan + one extra user add\u2011on, total cost 96 $/month for 4 users.**\n\nAny additional spend under your budget would only increase user count, not unlock new Dropbox features.",

            "answer": "Based on the optimization run against Trello\u2019s pricing and your budget of **$193/month**, the configuration that maximizes features without exceeding your limit is:\n\n> **Trello ENTERPRISE plan + ATLASSIAN_ACCESS add\u2011on**  \n> **Price:** **20.5 $ per user/month** (USD)\n\n- **17.50 $** for **ENTERPRISE**\n- **3 $** for **ATLASSIAN_ACCESS**\n- Total from the tool: **20.5 $**\n\nWith **$193/month**, this configuration fits up to:\n- **9 users** of Enterprise + Atlassian Access: 9 \u00d7 20.5 $ = **184.5 $** (within budget)  \n- **10 users** would be 205 $ (over your 193 $ limit)\n\n---\n\n### Why this is the \u201cbest features\u201d configuration\n\nThe optimizer was set to **maximize features** under your monthly cap. Among all Trello plans (Free, Standard, Premium, Enterprise) and the available add\u2011on (Atlassian Access), the combination that unlocks the **largest feature set** while costing under 193 $ is:\n\n**ENTERPRISE + ATLASSIAN_ACCESS**\n\nThis gives you:\n\n**1. Full collaboration and customization:**\n- Unlimited boards and workspaces (very high `boardsLimit` and `workspacesLimit`)\n- **Custom backgrounds & stickers**\n- **Advanced checklists** and **custom fields**\n- Power\u2011Ups (integrations with tools like Slack, Google Drive, Salesforce, Dropbox, etc.)\n- iOS, Android, and desktop apps\n\n**2. Advanced views and reporting (from PREMIUM/ENTERPRISE):**\n- **Dashboard view** for real\u2011time reporting\n- **Timeline view** for scheduling and sprint planning\n- **Workspace table view** (spreadsheet\u2011style cross\u2011board view)\n- **Calendar view** for start/due dates and checklist items\n- **Map view** for location\u2011based cards\n- **Workspace\u2011level templates**\n\n**3. Strong admin and governance (Enterprise\u2011only features):**\n- **Multi\u2011board guests** (guest access across multiple boards)\n- **Board collections** to group boards by department/project\n- **Observers** (view\u2011only users with restricted actions)\n- **Domain\u2011restricted invites** and ability to **deactivate members**\n- **Organization\u2011wide permissions** and **organization\u2011visible boards**\n- **Public board management** (control what is public)\n- **Power\u2011Up administration** and **attachment restrictions**\n- Centralized **command run administration** for automation\n\n**4. Security, identity, and compliance:**\n- Built\u2011in **2\u2011factor authentication**\n- **Mobile device management** support for Trello\u2019s mobile apps\n- With **ATLASSIAN_ACCESS add\u2011on**:\n  - **SingleSignOn** (SSO) across Atlassian products via your identity provider\n  - **enforce2FA** \u2013 enforce two\u2011factor authentication across users\n\n**5. Generous usage limits:**\n- **File attachments up to 250 MB/file**\n- Effectively **unlimited boards**, **unlimited Power\u2011Ups**, **unlimited automation commands**, and **unlimited workspaces** (usage limits are set extremely high or infinite in the YAML).\n\n---\n\n### Why this was chosen over cheaper plans\n\n- **STANDARD** and **PREMIUM** are cheaper per user but lack some **Enterprise\u2011only governance and org\u2011wide controls** (e.g., organization\u2011wide permissions, public board management, power\u2011up admin, unlimited workspaces).\n- Without **ATLASSIAN_ACCESS**, you don\u2019t get the full **enterprise SSO + enforced 2FA** identity controls across Atlassian products.\n- Since your total budget (193 $) is far above the **20.5 $ per user/month** needed for this configuration, the optimizer selected the **highest\u2011feature combination** that still fits comfortably under your cap.\n\n---\n\nIf you tell me **how many users you need**, I can confirm whether **Enterprise + Atlassian Access** fits that exact team size under 193 $, or show the best alternative (e.g., Enterprise without Access, or Premium) if you have more than 9 users to cover.",

            "answer": "Here\u2019s the optimal configuration based on your $152/month budget and the Figma pricing data provided.\n\n## Best configuration within $152/month\n\n**Recommended plan:** `ORGANIZATION`  \n**Price:** **45 USD per editor/month**  \n**Tool-selected optimal subscription:** one `ORGANIZATION` plan at **\"45 $\"**, with no add\u2011ons.\n\nBecause the optimization was set to **maximize features** under a **maxPrice of 152 USD**, it chose the **highest-tier plan (ORGANIZATION)**, which:\n\n- Is well under your budget at **$45/month per editor**\n- Includes **every feature** available in this pricing model\n- Has **no required paid add-ons** in this YAML\n\nYour budget of $152/month would allow up to:\n\n- 1 editor: $45/month  \n- 2 editors: $90/month  \n- 3 editors: $135/month  \n\nAll under your $152 cap. (4 editors would be $180 and exceed your limit.)\n\nSo, the **best feature configuration without exceeding your budget** is:\n\n> Use the **Figma ORGANIZATION plan** (up to 3 editors if needed) at **$45/editor/month**.\n\n---\n\n## Why this is the best option\n\nThe solver compared plans under the $152 cap and chose `ORGANIZATION` because it provides **strictly more features** than `PROFESSIONAL` and `STARTER` while still costing only **45 USD**, far below your limit.\n\nFrom the YAML:\n\n### All core design & prototyping (in all plans, including ORGANIZATION)\n\nThese are listed as default `true` features, and are included in ORGANIZATION:\n\n- `figmaEditor`, `advancedDrawingTools`, `styles`\n- `interactivePrototypes`, `overlays`, `transitions`, `advancedAnimations`\n- `developerHandoff`\n- `pdfPngJpgSvgExport`\n- `fileStorage`, `crossPlatform`, `sketchImport`\n- `plugins`, `restApis`, `thirdPartyIntegrations`, `liveEmbeds`\n- `multiplayer`, `shareableLinks`, `onCanvasCommenting`, `observationMode`\n- `components`\n\nYou get the full editor and prototyping toolset plus real-time collaboration across platforms.\n\n### Team & design system capabilities (enhanced at ORGANIZATION)\n\nCompared to lower tiers, ORGANIZATION enables:\n\n- `privateProjects`: private workspaces for sensitive work\n- `teams`: structured team groupings\n- `teamLibraries`: reusable shared components/styles\n- `organizationWideDesignSystems`: org-level design systems\n- `sharedFonts`: centrally managed fonts across the org\n\nThese are essential for scaled, multi-person product teams and large design systems.\n\n### Enterprise & admin controls (unique to ORGANIZATION)\n\nOnly the `ORGANIZATION` plan turns these on:\n\n- `privatePlugins`: internal-only plugins\n- `pluginManagement`: control over which plugins are available\n- `centralizedAdministration`: central control over org settings\n- `domainCapture`: automatically add users with your email domain\n- `linkAccessControls`: fine-grained sharing/access control\n- `fullContentOwnership`: organizational ownership of content\n- `singleSignOn`: SSO via identity providers\n- `activityLogs`: logs for auditing and compliance\n\nThese are the features that differentiate ORGANIZATION from PROFESSIONAL and are why, under a generous budget cap like yours, the solver selects ORGANIZATION as the \u201cbest features\u201d choice.\n\n### Usage limits: version history\n\nFrom the YAML:\n\n- `STARTER` default `versionHistoryDepth`: **30 days**\n- `PROFESSIONAL` and `ORGANIZATION`: `versionHistoryDepth: .inf` (effectively **unlimited version history**)\n\nSo ORGANIZATION gives you **unlimited version history**, which is important for long-running products and teams that need to audit or roll back work.\n\n---\n\n## Brief comparison to lower tiers\n\n- **STARTER (0 USD/editor/month)**  \n  - Free, but:\n    - No `privateProjects`, no `teamLibraries`, no `teams`\n    - 30-day `versionHistoryDepth`\n    - No advanced org/admin controls\n\n- **PROFESSIONAL (12 USD/editor/month)**  \n  - Adds:\n    - `privateProjects: true`\n    - `teamLibraries: true`\n    - Unlimited version history\n  - Still lacks:\n    - `teams`, `organizationWideDesignSystems`, `sharedFonts`\n    - `privatePlugins`, `pluginManagement`\n    - `centralizedAdministration`, `domainCapture`, `linkAccessControls`\n    - `fullContentOwnership`, `activityLogs`\n\n- **ORGANIZATION (45 USD/editor/month)**  \n  - Includes **everything in PROFESSIONAL**, plus:\n    - `teams`, `organizationWideDesignSystems`, `sharedFonts`\n    - `privatePlugins`, `pluginManagement`\n    - `centralizedAdministration`, `domainCapture`, `linkAccessControls`\n    - `fullContentOwnership`, `singleSignOn`, `activityLogs`\n  - Unlimited version history\n\nGiven your budget, there is **no reason to pick a lower tier on feature grounds**: ORGANIZATION is strictly superior and still fits easily under $152/month.\n\n---\n\n## Final recommendation\n\n- Plan: **Figma ORGANIZATION**\n- Price: **45 USD per editor/month**\n- Within a **$152/month budget**, you can support **up to 3 editors** on this plan.\n- This configuration gives you:\n  - Full design and prototyping capabilities\n  - Strong team and design system support\n  - Enterprise-grade admin, security, and governance features\n  - Unlimited version history\n\nIf you tell me how many active editors you plan to have, I can translate this into an exact monthly cost and confirm it against your $152 cap.",

Please check the pricing data or contact sales.\"`\n\nThere are **no storage add\u2011ons** defined in the YAML (only extra users, extra credits, and premium support), so the only way in this catalog to reach \u22655 GB is to use the **SCALE** plan, whose price is not numerically specified.\n\n---\n\n### Comparison for 5 GB Storage\n\nFor **at least 5 GB of storage**, based on the provided pricing data:\n\n- **Jira**\n  - Cheapest qualifying plan: **STANDARD**\n  - Storage provided: **250 GB**\n  - Price: **7 USD / user/month**\n\n- **CircleCI \u2013 Cloud**\n  - Cheapest qualifying plan: **SCALE**\n  - Storage provided: **200 GB**\n  - Price: **\u201cContact us\u201d (non\u2011numeric, custom quote)**\n\nBecause CircleCI\u2019s **SCALE** plan does not have a numeric price in the catalog (and the tool explicitly failed to compute a total cost for that reason), **we cannot determine from this data whether CircleCI is cheaper or more expensive than Jira for 5 GB of storage.**\n\nWhat we *can* say confidently is:\n\n- Jira\u2019s **STANDARD** plan will give you more than enough storage (250 GB) for **7 USD per user per month**.\n- For CircleCI \u2013 Cloud, the only plan in this dataset that supports 5 GB storage is **SCALE**, but its price is **not published** and requires contacting sales.\n\nIf you need a concrete, list\u2011price number today, Jira is the only one of the two for which we have a definitive cost for 5 GB storage in this dataset. To know whether CircleCI can undercut that, you\u2019d need to request a quote for the **SCALE** plan.",

You do *not* need this add\u2011on just to personally use 2FA.\n\n---\n\n### Wrike \u2013 2FA pricing\n\nWrike\u2019s 2FA feature in the YAML:\n\n- Feature: `twoFactorVerification`\n  - Description: \u201cAdd an extra layer of security, requiring a time-sensitive verification code along with a username and password.\u201d\n  - `defaultValue: false`\n  - Type: `INTEGRATION`, `integrationType: EXTERNAL_DEVICE`\n\nPlan availability:\n\n- **FREE** \u2013 price: `0` `user/month` \u2192 **does not** include `twoFactorVerification`\n- **PROFESSIONAL** \u2013 price: `49` `5 user/month` \u2192 **does not** include 2FA\n- **BUSINESS** \u2013 price: `124` `5 user/month` \u2192 **does not** include 2FA\n- **ENTERPRISE** \u2013 description: \u201cFor large teams: Enterprise-grade security and scalability\u201d\n  - Price: `Contact Sales`\n  - Includes: `twoFactorVerification: true`\n- **PINNACLE** \u2013 price: `Contact sales`, also includes `twoFactorVerification: true`\n\nThe optimization tool, filtering for `twoFactorVerification`, selected:\n\n- **Best Wrike plan with 2FA:** `ENTERPRISE`  \n- **Reported cost:**  \n  > \u201cSubscription cost includes non-numeric plan price, cannot calculate total cost. Please check the pricing data or contact sales.\u201d\n\nSo:\n\n- The **cheapest Wrike plan that supports 2FA is ENTERPRISE**, but its price is listed only as **\u201cContact Sales\u201d**\u2014no numeric cost is provided.\n- All lower, numerically priced Wrike plans (FREE, PROFESSIONAL at `49` per 5 users/month, BUSINESS at `124` per 5 users/month) **do not** include 2FA.\n\n---\n\n### Which is cheaper for 2FA?\n\nBased on the available pricing data:\n\n- **Trello:**  \n  - 2FA available on the **FREE** plan at a clearly specified cost of **`0 $` per user/month**.\n- **Wrike:**  \n  - 2FA only available starting from **ENTERPRISE** (and above), whose price is **not published** (shown as \u201cContact Sales\u201d), so we cannot compute an exact numeric cost.\n\nGiven that Trello explicitly offers two\u2011factor authentication on a **0 $** plan and Wrike only offers it on plans with **undisclosed \u201cContact Sales\u201d pricing**, the **cheapest known option for using two\u2011factor authentication is Trello\u2019s FREE plan**.\n\nIf your sole requirement is \u201cI need to perform two\u2011factor authentication,\u201d Trello Free is the cheaper (and only clearly priced) choice.  \nIf you later need enterprise\u2011grade controls and broader security features, Wrike ENTERPRISE or PINNACLE could be considered, but you would need to contact Wrike for actual pricing.",

            "answer": "Based on the archived pricing data you provided (2021\u20132025), there is **no way to quantify a price increase for Pumble\u2019s Server plan**, either in absolute or percentage terms.\n\nHere\u2019s why, grounded strictly in the YAML data:\n\n### 1. What the data shows for the **Server** plan\n\n**2021 (createdAt: 2021\u201109\u201120)**  \nPlans:\n\n- `FREE`: price **0 USD/user/month**\n- `PRO`: price **1.99 USD/user/month**\n- `SERVER`:  \n  - `price: Contact Sales`  \n  - `unit: user/month`  \n  - Same high\u2011end features as PRO (fileStoragePerUser, customizableSidebars, userGroups, etc.) but with effectively unlimited file storage per user.\n\nKey point: **SERVER does not have a numeric price**; it is a custom / quote\u2011based plan (\u201cContact Sales\u201d).\n\n---\n\n**2022 (createdAt: 2022\u201111\u201128)**  \nPlans:\n\n- `FREE`: **0 USD/user/month**\n- `PRO`: **1.99 USD/user/month**\n\nThere is **no `SERVER` plan** in the 2022 pricing YAML.\n\n---\n\n**2023 (createdAt: 2023\u201109\u201130)**  \nPlans:\n\n- `FREE`: **0 USD/user/month**\n- `PRO`: **1.99 USD/user/month**\n\nAgain, **no `SERVER` plan** appears.\n\n---\n\n**2024 (createdAt: 2024\u201107\u201116)**  \nPlans:\n\n- `FREE`: **0 USD/user/month**\n- `PRO` (\u201cOrganization\u201d): **2.99 USD/user/month**\n- `BUSINESS` (\u201cAdministration\u201d): **4.99 USD/user/month**\n- `ENTERPRISE` (\u201cControl & Security\u201d): **7.99 USD/user/month** (adds SSO, data retention, etc.)\n\nThe **Server plan no longer exists by name**. The high\u2011end needs that a \u201cserver\u201d offering might target are now covered by BUSINESS and ENTERPRISE, but they are **cloud SaaS tiers**, not labelled \u201cServer\u201d.\n\n---\n\n**2025 (createdAt: 2025\u201103\u201107, version: 2025)**  \nPlans:\n\n- `FREE`: **0 USD/user/month**\n- `PRO`: **2.49 USD/user/month**\n- `BUSINESS`: **3.99 USD/user/month**\n- `ENTERPRISE`: **6.99 USD/user/month**\n\nStill **no `SERVER` plan**. Prices of the top SaaS tiers actually **decrease** vs 2024, but these are not called Server.\n\n---\n\n### 2. Why a price increase cannot be computed\n\nTo calculate a price increase over 2021\u20132025, we would need:\n\n1. A **numeric baseline price** in 2021, and  \n2. A **numeric price for the same plan** (Server) in subsequent years.\n\nIn the data you provided:\n\n- **2021**: The `SERVER` plan price is explicitly `\"Contact Sales\"` \u2013 no numeric value is given, so there is **no list price** to use as a baseline.\n- **2022\u20132025**: There is **no `SERVER` plan at all** in the public pricing data. Instead, Pumble\u2019s publicly listed tiers evolve to FREE/PRO and then FREE/PRO/BUSINESS/ENTERPRISE.\n\nBecause:\n\n- The 2021 Server plan is **custom\u2011priced**, and  \n- The plan is **removed from the public pricing pages** afterward,\n\nthere is **no consistent numeric price series for \u201cServer\u201d**. That means:\n\n- **Absolute change** (e.g., \u201c+X USD per user/month\u201d) cannot be computed.\n- **Percentage change** (e.g., \u201c+Y% over 5 years\u201d) also cannot be computed.\n\nAny real\u2011world changes to Server pricing after 2021 would have been handled through private quotes and contracts, not through public list prices, so they are not observable in this dataset.\n\n### 3. Related context (but not Server-specific pricing)\n\nFor completeness, the **top public SaaS tiers** over time (not labelled \u201cServer\u201d) move as follows:\n\n- PRO: **1.99 \u2192 1.99 \u2192 1.99 \u2192 2.99 \u2192 2.49 USD/user/month** (2021\u21922025)\n- BUSINESS: introduced 2024 at **4.99**, then **3.99** in 2025\n- ENTERPRISE: introduced 2024 at **7.99**, then **6.99** in 2025\n\nThese tiers introduce features like **SSO**, **data retention**, advanced permissions, etc., which partially overlap with what you might expect from a \u201cServer\u201d or enterprise deployment, but they are **not presented as a Server plan in the pricing**.\n\n---\n\n### 4. Bottom line\n\nFrom the archived pricing YAMLs:\n\n- The **only year** where a \u201cServer\u201d plan appears (2021) lists the price as **\u201cContact Sales\u201d**, not a number.\n- From **2022 onward**, the **Server plan is no longer listed** on the public pricing pages.\n- Therefore, using only this authoritative pricing data, **we cannot quantify any price increase (absolute or percentage) for Pumble\u2019s Server plan between 2021 and 2025**.\n\nIf you have your own historical quotes or contracts for the Server plan, those would be the only reliable basis for calculating an actual price change.",

Also, `createCustomViews` becomes a default `true` feature, meaning even Viewer users can create personalized views.  \n  These additions indicate **more functionality bundled into Viewer** in 2025, coinciding with the large price jump to **35 USD/user/month**.\n\nAll figures above are taken directly from the archived Tableau pricing snapshots you provided and represent list prices in USD per user per month on those dates.",

Those terms might, for example, prohibit creating multiple free accounts to circumvent storage limits, user limits, or paid features.\n\nSo:\n\n- The pricing info does **not** show a restriction on multiple FREE accounts per person.\n- For a definitive, up-to-date answer (and to avoid violating their terms), you should:\n  - Check Canva\u2019s current Terms of Use and any \u201cFair Use\u201d or \u201cAccount\u201d section, or  \n  - Contact Canva support and ask if multiple FREE accounts for one person are allowed, especially if you intend to use them to bypass limits.",
